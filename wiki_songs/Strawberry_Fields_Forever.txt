It was released on 13 February 1967 as a double A-side single with \"[[Penny Lane]]\". It represented a departure from the group's previous singles and a novel listening experience for the contemporary pop audience. While the song initially divided and confused music critics and the group's fans, it proved highly influential on the emerging psychedelic genre. Its accompanying promotional film is similarly recognised as a pioneering work in the medium of music video.\n\nLennon based the song on his childhood memories of playing in the garden of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Field Strawberry Field], a Salvation Army children's home in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool Liverpool]. Starting in November 1966, the band spent 45 hours in the studio, spread over five weeks, creating three versions of the track. The final recording combined two of those versions, which were entirely different in tempo, mood and musical key. It features reverse-recorded instrumentation, Mellotron flute sounds, an Indian swarmandal, tape loops and a fade-out/fade-in coda, as well as a cello and brass arrangement by producer [[George Martin]]. For the promotional film, the band used experimental techniques such as reverse effects, jump-cuts and superimposition.\n\nThe song was the first track the Beatles recorded after completing ''[[Revolver]]'' and was intended for inclusion on their forthcoming ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. Instead, with pressure from their record company and management for new product, the group were forced to issue the single, and then adhered to their philosophy of omitting previously released singles from their albums. The double A-side peaked at number 2 on the ''Record Retailer'' chart, thereby breaking the band's four-year run of chart-topping singles in the UK. In the US, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" peaked at number 8 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. To the band's displeasure, the song was later included on the US [[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|''Magical Mystery Tour'' LP]].\n\nLennon viewed \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" as his finest work with the Beatles. After his death, a section of New York's Central Park was named after the song. In 1996, the discarded first version of the song was issued on the outtakes compilation ''[[Anthology 2]]''; in 2006, a new version was created for the remix album ''[[Love (album)|Love]]''. Artists who have covered the song include Richie Havens, Todd Rundgren, Peter Gabriel, Ben Harper, and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs featuring Debbie Harry. In 1990, a version by the Madchester group Candy Flip became a top-ten hit in the UK and Ireland.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Chorus]\n\nLet me take you down 'cause I'm going to\n\nStrawberry Fields\n\nNothing is real\n\nAnd nothing to get hung about\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nLiving is easy with eyes closed\n\nMisunderstanding all you see\n\nIt's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out\n\nIt doesn't matter much to me\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nLet me take you down 'cause I'm going to\n\nStrawberry Fields\n\nNothing is real\n\nAnd nothing to get hung about\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nNo one I think is in my tree\n\nI mean it must high or low\n\nThat is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right\n\nThat is I think it's not to bad\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nLet me take you down 'cause I'm going to\n\nStrawberry Fields\n\nNothing is real\n\nAnd nothing to get hung about\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nAlways know sometimes think it's me\n\nBut you know I know when it's a dream\n\nI think I know, I mean, er yes, but it's all wrong\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nLet me take you down 'cause I'm going to\n\nStrawberry Fields\n\nNothing is real\n\nAnd nothing to get hung about\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever\n\n\n[Outro]\n\n(Cranberry sauce...)\n\n<br />\n== Personnel ==\n* [[John Lennon]] - Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]]), Bongos, Mellotron\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Mellotron (Mark II), Bass Guitar ([[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Lead Guitar (1964 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]]), Piano (Hamburg Steinway Baby Grand), Timpani\n* [[George Harrison]] - Lead Guitar ([[Fender Stratocaster]]), Slide Guitar ([[Fender Stratocaster]]), Swarmandel, Maracas\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - Drums (1964 Ludwig Super Classic Black Oyster Pearl), Backwards Cymbals, Percussion\n* [[Mal Evans]] - Tambourine\n* [[Neil Aspinall]] - Guiro\n* Terry Doran - Maracas\n* Tony Fisher - Trumpet\n* Greg Bowen - Trumpet\n* Derek Watkins - Trumpet\n* Stanley Roderick - Trumpet\n* John Hall - Cello\n* Derek Simpson - Cello\n* Norman Jones - Cello\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{song stub}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/strawberry-fields-forever/magical-mystery-tour Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on Magical Mystery Tour]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:1967 songs]]\n[[Category:Non-album singles]]"}}}]}}}}
