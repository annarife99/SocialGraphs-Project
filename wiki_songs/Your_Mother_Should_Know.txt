It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] (credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]]).<ref name=\"miles1p355\">Miles (1997), p. 355.</ref><ref name=\"sheff1p198\">Sheff (2000), p. 198.</ref>\n\n==In the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' film==\n\nMcCartney said he wrote it as a production number for the movie ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'',<ref name=\"miles1p355\"/> supporting an old-fashioned dance segment that starts with the Beatles coming down a grand staircase in white tuxedoes. After they descend, boy scouts, RAF cadets and other groups march through. [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ringo Starr]] are wearing red carnations, while McCartney's is black. The carnation difference contributed to the \"[[Paul is dead]]\" controversy.<ref name=\"miles1p356\">Miles (1997), p. 356.</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nThe song was recorded in three sessions on 22 August, 16 September, and 29 September 1967. The remake from 16 September was left unused, and [[Wikipedia:Overdub|overdubs]] layered on the best take from 22 August.<ref name=\"lewisohn1p122-128\">Lewisohn (1988), pp. 122-128.</ref> Mixing did not go any smoother, with sessions on 29 September, 30 September and 7 November 1967.<ref name=\"lewisohn1p128-130\">Lewisohn (1988), pp. 128-130.</ref>\n\nThe 22 August session took place at Chappell Recording Studios because [[Abbey Road Studios]] was unavailable that night.
