In the US, [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] released it as the last track on ''[[Beatles VI]]''.\n\n==Composition==\nMcCartney wrote the song in a music room at the home of [[Jane Asher]] where he was living at the time. He had hopes it would be released as a single, but it \"didn't have quite what was required\", and was released on ''Beatles for Sale'' instead.\n\nThe song is somewhat unusual for Lennon/McCartney in that the lead singer, [[John Lennon]], was not the primary composer. McCartney sings harmony, although one can hear him better in the refrain. The song's composer is not in question: McCartney claimed the song as described above, and Lennon said in an interview with ''Playboy'' that McCartney wrote it.\n\n==Recording==\nThe released version was recorded with 4 takes at [[Abbey Road Studios]] on 29 September 1964, and then five more on 30 September. The Beatles were enjoying themselves on the second night; take six was aborted due to McCartney burping his vocals, and take seven was finished but ended in loud laughter. It is one of the few early Beatles songs to feature an instrument that did not usually appear on rock 'n roll songs: [[Ringo Starr]] plays the timpani on the track to add punctuating one-two flourishes to the refrains. This appeared for the first time on the ninth take, along with a guitar intro and piano piece.\n\n==Reviews==\nMusic critic Ian MacDonald praised the song's \"emotional depth\" and used this song and others as counter-arguments to the caricature of McCartney as an emotional lightweight. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic also praised the song and its \"infectious chorus\".\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[John Lennon]] - lead vocals, lead guitar ([[Rickenbacker 325|1964 Rickenbacker 325/12]])\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 bass guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1963 Hofner 500/1]]), harmony vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 acoustic rhythm guitar ([[Gibson J-160E|1962 Gibson J-160E]])\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - drums, timpani\n*[[George Martin]] - piano, producer\n*[[Norman Smith]] - engineer\n\n==Cover versions==\n* In 1969, Yes covered this song on their self-titled debut album. Their cover turned the song into a wall of sound with several tempo and key changes and an extended jam opening.\n* In 1986, Lou Ann Barton did a version on her EP ''Forbidden Tones''.\n* In 2003, Peter Lipa included this song and 15 other Lennon/McCartney songs on his album ''Beatles in Blue(s)''\n* In 2004, Martin Gordon released a cover on ''The Joy of More Hogwash''.\n\n==Notes==\n# A lot of covers on YouTube have a Rickenbacker 360/12 being used\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book\n  |last=Lewisohn\n  |first=Mark\n  |year=1988\n  |authorlink=Mark Lewisohn\n  |title=The Beatles Recording Sessions\n  |publisher=Harmony Books\n  |location=New York\n  |isbn=0-517-57066-1\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |last=MacDonald\n  |first=Ian\n  |year=2005\n  |authorlink=Ian MacDonald\n  |title=Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties\n  |publisher=Pimlico (Rand)\n  |edition=Second Revised\n  |location=London\n  |isbn=1-844-13828-3\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |last=Miles\n  |first=Barry\n  |year=1997\n  |authorlink=Barry Miles\n  |title=Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now\n  |publisher=Henry Holt and Company\n  |location=New York\n  |isbn=0-8050-5249-6\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |last=Sheff\n  |first=David\n  |year=2000\n  |authorlink=David Sheff\n  |title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono\n  |publisher=St. Martin's Press\n  |location=New York\n  |isbn=0-312-25464-4\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web\n  |last=Unterberger\n  |first=Richie\n  |year=2009\n  |authorlink=Richie Unterberger\n  |title=Review of \"Every Little Thing\"\n  |publisher=allmusic\n  |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:jbfwxvqjldje\n  |accessdate=2009-09-11\n  |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Beatles for Sale]]"}}}]}}}}
