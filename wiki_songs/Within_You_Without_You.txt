Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]. It features only Harrison and a group of uncredited Indian musicians, although producer [[George Martin]] arranged the string section, and Harrison and assistant [[Neil Aspinall]] played the tambura. According to Prema Music, dilrubha player Amrit Gajjar played on the track. It is the second of Harrison's songs to be explicitly influenced by Indian classical music, after \"[[Love You To]]\", and Harrison's only composition on Sgt. Pepper. \"Within You Without You\" was written on a harmonium at the house of long-time Beatles friend [[Klaus Voormann]], while \"there were lots of joints being smoked\".\n\nThe song, originally written as a 30-minute piece and trimmed down into a mini-version for the album, is in Mixolydian mode. The laughter at the end was Harrison's idea to lighten the mood and follow the theme of the album. Sped up to C#, an instrumental version at the original speed and key appears on the ''[[Anthology 2]]'' album.\n\nThe song was also included on the 2006 remix album [[Love (album)|Love]]. For this album, George Harrison's lyrics and melody were mixed over the rhythm of \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\", and elements of the percussion were placed alongside \"[[Love You To]]\" in \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\". The blending of these two similar songs is considered the most effective form of mashup on the album. All of the music for Love was remixed and remastered by the Beatles producer Sir George Martin and his son [[Giles Martin|Giles]]. The ''Love'' remix is one of the songs in ''[[The Beatles: Rock Band]]''. The original version was also released as downloadable content along with the rest of the ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' album in November 2009.\n\n\"Within You Without You\" is also the most popular of the Harrison Indian sitar songs.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse 1]\n\nWe were talking about the space between us all\n\nAnd the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion\n\nNever glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nWe were talking about the love we all could share\n\nWhen we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love\n\nWith our love, we could save the world, if they only knew\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nTry to realise it's all within yourself\n\nNo one else can make you change\n\nAnd to see you're really only very small\n\nAnd life flows on within you and without you\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nWe were talking about the love that's gone so cold\n\nAnd the people who gain the world and lose their soul\n\nThey don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWhen you've seen beyond yourself then you may find\n\nPeace of mind is waiting there\n\nAnd the time will come when you see we're all one\n\nAnd life flows on within you and without you\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nHa-ha-ha-ha\n\nHa-ha-ha-ha-ha\n\nHa-ha!\n\n== Personnel[[Category:Songs on Sgt.
