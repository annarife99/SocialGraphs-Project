It was included on the [[Live at the BBC]] album. It was recorded on 2 June, 1964, and released on 10 July, 1964 in stereo. It was composed for the film A Hard Day's Night and appears on the soundtrack album. It was also released as the B-side of the \"A Hard Day's Night\" single in the UK.\n\n==Composition==\nMcCartney wrote the song in May 1964 while cruising the Caribbean aboard a yacht called Happy Days with his then-girlfriend Jane Asher. Music critic Ian MacDonald said, \"The sombre lyric\u2014provoked by the frustrating interruptions of a relationship between two career people\u2014matches the lowering gloom of the music.\"\n\nThe song is one of three main compositions (along with \"And I Love Her\" and \"Can't Buy Me Love\") that Paul McCartney wrote for the film. Recorded in advance of film production for lip-synching reasons, \"Things We Said Today\" has a reverse nostalgia premise. McCartney said, \"I wrote this on acoustic. It was a slightly nostalgic thing already, a future nostalgia. We\u2019ll remember the things we said today, sometime in the future, so the song projects itself into the future.\"\n\n==Credits==\n\n*[[John Lennon]] - rhythm guitar ([[Gibson J-160E|1962 Gibson J-160E]]), piano (1905 Steinway Vertegrand)\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - lead vocals, bass ([[Hofner 500/1|1963 Hofner 500/1]])\n* [[George Harrison]] - lead guitar ([[Grestch Tennessean|1963 Gretsch 6119 Tennessean]])\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - drums (1964 Ludwig Super Classic Black Oyster Pearl)\n{{song stub}}\n\n[[es:Things We Said Today]]\n[[ru:Things We Said Today]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on A Hard Day's Night]]"}}}]}}}}
