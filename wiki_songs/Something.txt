It was the first song written by [[George Harrison]] to appear on the A-side of a Beatles single. It was one of the first Beatles singles to contain tracks already available on an LP album, with both \"''Something''\" and \"[[Come Together]]\" having appeared on Abbey Road. \"''Something''\" was the only Harrison composition to top the American charts while he was a Beatle.\n\nThe track is generally considered a love song to Pattie Boyd, Harrison's first wife, although Harrison offered alternative sources of inspiration in later interviews. Owing to the difficulty he faced in getting more than two of his compositions onto each Beatles album, Harrison first offered the song to Joe Cocker. As recorded by the Beatles, the track features a guitar solo that several music critics identify among Harrison's finest playing. The song also drew praise from the other Beatles and their producer, [[George Martin]], with [[John Lennon|Lennon]] stating that it was the best song on ''Abbey Road''. The promotional film for the single combined footage of each of the Beatles with his respective wife, reflecting the estrangement in the band during the months preceding their break-up in April 1970. Harrison subsequently performed the song at his Concert for Bangladesh shows in 1971 and throughout the two tours he made as a solo artist.\n\n[[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]\u2014the two principal songwriting members of the band\u2014both praised \"Something\" as among the best songs Harrison had written. As well as critical acclaim, the single achieved commercial success, topping the Billboard charts in the United States, and entering the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The song's success continued after the breakup of The Beatles, when it was covered by over 150 artists including [[wikipedia:Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley]], [[wikipedia:Shirley Bassey|Shirley Bassey]], [[wikipedia:Frank Sinatra|Frank Sinatra]], [[wikipedia:James Brown|James Brown]], [[wikipedia:Julio Iglesias|Julio Iglesias]], [[wikipedia:Smokey Robinson|Smokey Robinson]], Beatallica (calling it \"Something [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Else_Matters Else Matters]\") and [[wikipedia:Joe Cocker|Joe Cocker]], becoming the second-most covered Beatles song after ''[[Yesterday]]''.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse 1]\n\nSomething in the way she moves\n\nAttracts me like no other lover\n\nSomething in the way she woos me\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI don't want to leave her now\n\nYou know I believe and how\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nSomewhere in her smile she knows\n\nThat I don't need no other lover\n\nSomething in her style that shows me\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI don't want to leave her now\n\nYou know I believe and how\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nYou're asking me will my love grow\n\nI don't know, I don't know\n\nYou stick around, now it may show\n\nI don't know, I don't know\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nSomething in the way she knows\n\nAnd all I have to do is think of her\n\nSomething in the things she shows me\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI don't want to leave her now\n\nYou know I believe and how\n\n==Credits==\n\n*[[George Harrison]] - Lead Vocals, Lead and Rhythm Guitar (1957 [[Gibson Les Paul Standard]])\n*[[John Lennon]] - Piano\n*[[Paul McCartney]] - Backing Vocals and Bass Guitar (1966 [[Fender Jazz Bass]]) or (1963 H\u00f6fner 500/1) or (1964 Rickenbacker 4001S)\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - Drums\n*[[Billy Preston]] - Hammond Organ\n* Unknown - Twelve Violins,Four Violas,Four Cellos and Double Bass\n[[Category:The Beatles singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by George Harrison]]\n[[Category:A-sides]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Abbey Road]]"}}}]}}}}
