A product of McCartney's deliberate effort to create a sound as loud and dirty as possible, the clangorous piece has been noted for both its \"proto-metal roar\" and \"unique textures.\" In fact, it has been described as one of the first songs of the heavy metal music genre. The song was ranked #52 on the Rolling Stone Magazine's \"The Beatles 100 Greatest songs\" list.\n\n==Inspiration==\nMcCartney was inspired to write the song after reading a 1967 ''Guitar Player'' magazine interview with The Who's Pete Townshend where he described their latest single, \"I Can See for Miles,\" as the loudest, rawest, dirtiest song the Who had ever recorded. McCartney then \"wrote 'Helter Skelter' to be the most raucous vocal, the loudest drums, et cetera\" and said he was \"using the symbol of a {{w|Helter skelter (ride)|helter skelter}}  as a ride from the top to the bottom \u2014 the rise and fall of the Roman Empire \u2014 and this was the fall, the demise.\" In British English, the term helter-skelter not only has its meaning of \"in disorderly haste or confusion\" but is the name of a spiralling amusement park slide. McCartney has used this song as a response to critics who accuse him of only writing ballads.\n\nOn 20 November 1968, two days before the release of ''The Beatles'', McCartney gave Radio Luxembourg an exclusive interview, in which he commented on several of the album\u2019s songs. Speaking of \"Helter Skelter,\" he said the following: \"Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, 'and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.' And I just remember thinking, 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great \u2014 really screaming record.' And then I heard their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' And I had this song called \"Helter Skelter,\" which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise.\"\n\n==Recording==\nThe Beatles recorded the song multiple times during sessions for ''The White Album''. During the 18 July 1968 sessions, a version of the song lasting, lasting nearly half an hour: 27 minutes and 11 seconds, to be specific, was recorded, although this version is rather slow and hypnotic, differing greatly from the volume and rawness of the album version. Another recording from the same day, originally 12 minutes long, was edited down to 4:37 for ''[[Anthology 3]]''. On 9 September, 18 takes of approximately five minutes each were recorded, and the last one is featured on the original LP. After the 18th take, [[Ringo Starr]] flung his sticks across the studio and screamed, \"I've got blisters on my fingers!\" The Beatles included Starr's shout on the stereo mix of the song (available on CD); the song completely fades out around 3:40, then gradually fades back in, fades back out partially, and quickly fades back in with three cymbal crashes and Ringo's scream (some sources erroneously credit the \"blisters\" line to Lennon because in the video he can be seen screaming at the end; in fact, Lennon can be heard asking \"How's that?\" before the outburst). The mono version (originally on LP only) ends on the first fadeout without Ringo's outburst. The mono version was not initially available in the US as mono albums had already been phased out there. The mono version was later released in the American version of the ''[[Rarities (American)|Rarities]]'' album. In 2009, it was made available on the CD mono re-issue of the ''White Album'' as part of the ''[[The Beatles in Mono|Beatles in Mono]]'' CD box set.\n\nAccording to Chris Thomas, who was present, the recording of the final version was especially spirited. \"While Paul was doing his vocal, [[George Harrison]] had set fire to an ashtray and was running around the studio with it above his head, doing an Arthur Brown.\" Starr's recollection is less detailed, but agrees in spirit: \"'Helter Skelter' was a track we did in total madness and hysterics in the studio. Sometimes you just had to shake out the jams.\"\ufeff\n\n==Credits==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] - Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar (1962 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino|Epiphone Casino]]), Lead Guitar (1964 Fender Esquire), Piano (1905 Steimway Grand)\n*[[John Lennon]] -  Backing Vocals, Six-String Bass Guitar (1968 [[Fender Bass VI]]), Saxophone.\n*[[George Harrison]] - Backing Vocals, Lead and Slide Guitar (1957 [[Gibson Les Paul Standard|Gibson Les Paul]] ) and Sound Effects\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - Drums (Ludwig Super Classic Black Oyster Pearl), Shout (at the end)\n*[[Mal Evans]]  - Trumpet\n\n==Critical reaction==\nThe song has been covered by a number of bands (see below) and praised by critics, including Richie Unterberger of AllMusic. Unterberger called it \"one of [the] fiercest and most brutal rockers done by anyone\" and \"extraordinary.\" Ian MacDonald was critical, calling it \"ridiculous, McCartney shrieking weedily against a massively tape-echoed backdrop of out-of-tune thrashing.\" Alan W. Pollack said the song will \"scare and unsettle\" listeners, citing \"Helter Skelter\"'s \"obsessive nature\" and \"undercurrent of violence\", and noted \"Paul's savage vocal delivery\" as reinforcing this theme.\n\nIn a 1980 interview, Lennon said, \"That's Paul ''completely'' ... It has nothing to do with anything, and least of all to do with ''me''.\"\n\nIn March 2005, ''Q'' magazine ranked \"Helter Skelter\" number 5 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.\n==Cover versions==\n*In 1975, Aerosmith recorded a cover of \"Helter Skelter\", but it was not released until 1991, on the ''Pandora's Box'' compilation.
