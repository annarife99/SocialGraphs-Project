In this, George is rebelling against British taxes, whereby over time, he figured that most of their earnings went to taxes. Its lyrics attack the high levels of progressive tax taken by the British Labour government of Harold Wilson. Although George was [[The Beatles]]' lead guitar player, the famous guitar solo, believed by many to be played by George, was actually done by [[Paul McCartney|Paul]]. It was recorded on April 21 and 22, and May 16, and June 21, 1966; and released on 5 August, 1966.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAs well as Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister of the day, the song also name-checks Edward Heath, the Opposition leader.\n\n==Credits==\n* [[George Harrison]] - Lead Vocals, Lead Guitar ([[Fender Stratocaster]])\n* [[John Lennon]] - Harmony Vocals, Rhythm Guitar ([[Fender Stratocaster]])\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Bass Guitar ([[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Harmony Vocals, Lead Guitar Solos ([[Epiphone 230TD Casino]])\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - Drums, Cowbell, Tambourine\n\n{{stub}}\n[[Category:Songs written by George Harrison]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:1966 songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Revolver]]"}}}]}}}}
