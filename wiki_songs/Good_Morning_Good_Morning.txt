Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] album.\n\nInspiration for the song came to Lennon from a television commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The jingle went: \"Good morning, good morning, The best to you each morning, Sunshine Breakfast, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Crisp and full of fun\".\n\nThe line \"It's time for tea and Meet the Wife\" refers to a BBC sitcom Meet the Wife.\n\n==Recording==\nThe track was recorded on February 8, 1967, with overdubs on February 16 (bass and vocals), March 13 (brass section), March 28 (backing vocals and guitar solo), and March 29 (animal noises). The guitar solo was played by [[Paul McCartney]] on a Fender Esquire.\n\nAt Lennon's request, [[George Martin]] brought in Sounds Incorporated to play the brass section with their signature saxophone sound.\n\nLennon asked engineer [[Geoff Emerick]] to arrange the animal noises heard at the end of the song so that the animal was capable of devouring or frightening the animal that came before it.\n\nDespite the peaceful title, the song is highly aggressive. With loud french horns, animal noises, pounding drums, strong vocals and large amounts of complex strumming guitar, it is quite a powerful wake-up call.\n\nThis song features double-bass drum playing by [[Ringo Starr]].\n\nThe final sound effect of a chicken clucking was so placed that it transforms into the guitar on the following track \"[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)]]\". It is one of the reasons that people have argued that the album is the first concept album.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Chorus]\n\nGood morning, good morning\n\nGood morning, good morning\n\nGood morning ah\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nNothing to do to save his life call his wife in\n\nNothing to say but what a day how's your boy been\n\nNothing to do it's up to you\n\nI've got nothing to say but it's OK\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nGood morning, good morning\n\nGood morning ah\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nGoing to work don't want to go feeling low down\n\nHeading for home you start to roam then you're in town\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nEverybody knows there's nothing doing\n\nEverything is closed it's like a ruin\n\nEveryone you see is half asleep\n\nAnd you're on your own you're in the street\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nAfter a while you start to smile now you feel cool\n\nThen you decide to take a walk by the old school\n\nNothing is changed it's still the same\n\nI've got nothing to say but it's OK\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nGood morning, good morning\n\nGood morning ah\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nPeople running round it's five o'clock\n\nEverywhere in town is getting dark\n\nEveryone you see is full of life\n\nIt's time for tea and Meet the Wife\n\n\n[Verse 4]\n\nSomebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here\n\nWatching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear\n\nGo to a show you hope she goes\n\nI've got nothing to say but it's OK\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\nGood morning, good morning, good\n\n==Credits==\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 Lead and Harmony Vocals, Rhythm Guitar ([[Epiphone 230TD Casino]])\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 Bass Guitar ([[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Lead Guitar ([[Fender Esquire]]), Bass Drum, Backing Vocals\n* [[George Harrison]] \u2013 Tambourine, Backing Vocals\n* [[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 Drums (Ludwig Super Clasic Black Oyster Pearl)\n* Barrie Cameron \u2013\u00a0Saxophone\n* David Glyde \u2013 Saxophone\n* Alan Holmes \u2013 Saxophone\n* John Lee \u2013\u00a0Trombone\n* Griff West \u2013 Trombone\n* Tom \u2013\u00a0French Horn\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on Sgt.
