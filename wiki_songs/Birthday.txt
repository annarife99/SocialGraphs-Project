Just made up on the spot. I think [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] just wanted to write a song like \"Happy Birthday Baby,\" the old 50's hit.

Paul returned early to finish the song, and by early morning, the entire mix was created. Little known, the clapping during the bridge is [[Pattie Boyd]], George Harrison's first wife, and [[Yoko Ono]].\n\n==Recording==\n'''September 18, 1968''', 5:00 pm-4:30 am- Mono mixing. Engineer Chris Thomas commented in ''The Beatles Recording Sessions'' about the track: \"Paul was the first one in, and he was playing the 'Birthday' riff. Eventually the other arrived, by which time Paul had literally written the song, right there in the studio.\" [[The Beatles]] recorded 20 takes. During the evening, the group took a break and went to Paul's house to watch the British TV premiere of the movie ''The Girl Can't Help It'', which aired from 9:05 to 10:40. They returned to the studio around 11:00 pm to complete the vocals. The song was recorded on a four-track, but transferred to an eight-track to accommodate all the overdubs and instruments.\n\n'''October 14, 1968'''- Stereo mixing\n\n'''November 22, 1968'''- First released on the UK LP ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]] ''(aka ''The White Album'').\n\n==Credits==\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 Lead Vocals, Lead Guitar (1962 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino|Epiphone Casino]]), Piano (1964 Challen Upright 861634) and Handclaps\n* [[John Lennon]]\u2013 Lead and Harmony Vocals, Lead Guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]]) and Handclaps\n* [[George Harrison ]]\u2013 Bass Guitar (1968 [[Fender Bass VI|Fender VI]]) and Handclaps\n* [[Ringo Starr ]]\u2013 Drums (1964 Ludwig Super Classic Black Oyster Pearl), Tambourine and Handclaps\n*[[Pattie Boyd]] \u2013 Backing Vocals and Handclaps\n* [[Yoko Ono ]]\u2013 Backing Vocals and Handclaps\n*[[Mal Evans]] \u2013 Handclaps\n''Note'': Some sources say that only Ringo and Mal Evans provided handclaps; and that [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] also sang in chorus.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Prior to writing \"Birthday,\" Paul had been thinking about the song \"Happy, Happy Birthday,\" a 1957 hit for the Tune Weavers.\n*Some sources say the song was written for Patti Harrison, who celebrated her birthday while the Beatles were in Rishikesh.
