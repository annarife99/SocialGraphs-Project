It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and is credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]].\n==Structure==\nThe song begins with two verses sung by McCartney in a large-sound, almost classical style. This is followed by a section played in a double time swing feel with McCartney switching to a more nasal vocal style, using a mock-baritone voice which contrasts the song's somewhat poignant lyrics. Next comes an instrumental interlude with [[George Harrison]]'s aggressive blues rock-style and a concluding unison line between guitar and bass. The song fades out with a chant reminiscent of a nursery rhyme, set to a Harrison guitar riff similar to a previous album track, \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" (in turn based on a previous Harrison/[[Eric Clapton]] composition, \"Badge\"). The riff will return later in the medley's track \"[[Carry That Weight]]\". The song's production is notable for prominent use of leslie-amplified, arpeggiated guitar parts, which would become synonymous with the late-era Beatles sound.\n\nIt slowly and quietly segues into \"[[Sun King]]\".\n==Recording==\nThe Beatles recorded 26 takes of \"You Never Give Me Your Money\" on 6 May 1969, with McCartney on piano and vocals, Lennon and Harrison on electric guitars and Starr on drums. At this early stage the song ended abruptly prior to the \"One two three four five six seven\" refrain.\n\nOn 1 July McCartney overdubbed lead vocals onto take 30, and added more vocals and chimes on 15 July.\n\n\"You Never Give Me Your Money\" was originally to segue into \"Sun King\" with a long organ note. This was recorded along with more vocals on 30 July. They were scrapped the following day, when McCartney completed the song by adding bass guitar and piano. The \"Sun King\" crossfade was completed on 5 August with a series of tape loops containing the sounds of bells, birds, bubbles and insects.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse 1]\n\nYou never give me your money\n\nYou only give me your funny paper\n\nAnd in the middle of negotiations\n\nYou break down\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nI never give you my number\n\nI only give you my situation\n\nAnd in the middle of investigation\n\nI break down\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nOut of college, money spent\n\nSee no future, pay no rent\n\nAll the money\u2019s gone, nowhere to go\n\nAny jobber got the sack\n\nMonday morning, turning back \n\nYellow lorry slow, nowhere to go\n\nBut oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go\n\nOh, that magic feeling\n\nNowhere to go\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nOne sweet dream\n\nPick up the bags and get in the limousine\n\nSoon we\u2019ll be away from here\n\nStep on the gas and wipe that tear away\n\nOne sweet dream came true, today\n\nCame true, today\n\nCame true, today (yes it did!)\n\n(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haa!)\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nOne two three four five six seven,\n\nAll good children go to Heaven\n\nOne two three four five six seven,\n\nAll good children go to Heaven\n\nOne two three four five six seven,\n\nAll good children go to Heaven\n\nOne two three four five six seven,\n\nAll good children go to Heaven\n\nOne two three four five six seven,\n\nAll good children go to Heaven\n\nOne two three four five six seven,\n\nAll good children go to Heaven\n\nOne two three four five six seven,\n\nAll good children go to Heaven\n\nOne two three four five six seven,\n\nAll good children go to Heaven\n\nOne two three four five six seven,\n\nAll good children go to Heaven\n\n==Credits==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] - lead, harmony and backing vocals, piano, tack piano, Leslie piano, bass ([[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), wind chimes, tubular bells, tape loops\n*[[John Lennon]] - lead guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]]), backing vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] - lead guitar (1968 Fender Rosewood Telecaster), backing vocals\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - drums, tambourine\n\nCrickets: Abbey Road Sound Effects Reel Volume 23: Jungle Noises\n\n==Covers==\n*In 1976, Will Malone & Lou Reizner covered the song for the transitory musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''.\n*Sufjan Stevens alludes to this song in \"Dear Mr. Supercomputer\" on his 2006 album ''The Avalanche''.
