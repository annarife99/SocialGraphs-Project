It was written by McCartney and originally recorded during the sessions for what became the Beatles' ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'' album (1970). Several versions exist, all of which are acoustic, some of which included electric guitar or improvised harmony vocals.\n\nThe Beatles recorded the song a number of times in January 1969, at their Apple Studios in London. A composite version made of two of these recordings was released in 1996 on the ''[[Anthology 3]]'' album.\n\nAccording to Paul McCartney in the documentary ''Wingspan'', McCartney wrote this for the Beatles' ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'' sessions, but due to tension in the Beatles at the time nobody had the patience to work with the song, so Paul worked on it alone and released a rough demo on ''Anthology 3'', and a final version appeared on his solo album ''McCartney''.\n==Song summary==\n\"Teddy Boy\", tells the story of young boy whose mother tells him to be good.
