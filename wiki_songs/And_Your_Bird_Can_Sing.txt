The songwriting credit is [[Lennon/McCartney]], though the song was written primarily by [[John Lennon]]. However, [[Paul McCartney]] claims to have helped on the lyric, estimating the song as \"80-20\" to Lennon.{{sfn|MacDonald|2003|p=199}} The working title was \"You Don't Get Me\". Lennon was later dismissive of the song, as he was of many of his compositions at the time, referring to it as \"another of my throwaways&nbsp;... fancy paper around an empty box\".<ref>David Sheff, ''All We Are Saying'', p. 180</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe song, a hard-edged rocker, is memorable for its extended dual-guitar melody, played by [[George Harrison]] and [[Paul McCartney]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=46}} A version of the song featuring Harrison on his Rickenbacker 12-string guitar was recorded on 20 April 1966 but was scrapped; the group recorded the album version on 26 April.<ref>Mark Lewisohn, ''The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions'', p. 22, 24</ref> The rejected version, heard on the ''[[Anthology 2]]'' album, features a vocal track on which Lennon and McCartney are giggling hysterically. The ''Anthology'' liner notes state that the tapes do not indicate the source of the laughter.\n\nA number of incidents have been suggested as inspirations for the song's cryptic lyrics, which recall in tone those of [[She Said She Said]]:\n*Jonathan Gould, in a 2007 book, ''Can't Buy Me Love'', claims Lennon wrote the song in response to an official press release promoting a Sinatra TV special as a show for those who were \"tired of kid singers wearing mops of hair thick enough to hide a crate of melons.\" No Lennon biography or Lennon quotation is cited to substantiate Gould's theory.\n*According to journalist Richard Simpson, Lennon wrote the song in response to Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones boasting about his pop-star girlfriend (\"bird\" in British slang) Marianne Faithfull.\n* The line \"You say you've seen seven wonders\" may refer to the night the Beatles smoked pot with [[Bob Dylan]] in New York in 1964. The experience caused a stoned McCartney to excitedly pronounce what he had just learned was the key to life: \"There are seven levels.\" <ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|title=78 - 'And Your Bird Can Sing'|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/and-your-bird-can-sing-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n\"And Your Bird Can Sing\" was used as the theme song of the [[The Beatles (animated series)|Beatles's cartoon series]] during its third season.
