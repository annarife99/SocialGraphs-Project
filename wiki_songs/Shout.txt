{"batchcomplete":"","query":{"pages":{"6540":{"pageid":6540,"ns":0,"title":"Shout","revisions":[{"slots":{"main":{"contentmodel":"wikitext","contentformat":"text/x-wiki","*":"'''''Shout''''' is an Isley Brothers song, not to be confused with the better-known \"[[Twist and Shout]]\" (written by Russell and Medley, and recorded by the Isley Brothers under its original title, \"Shake it Up, Baby\"). In its original form, it is too long for a conventional single and the Isleys thus spread it over two sides. Covers are usually shortened versions.\n\nThe Beatles are not known to have performed this song very often; there is one version, on ''[[Anthology 1]]'', which is described as a rarity. However, fellow Merseybeat band Lulu and the Luvvers had a hit with this song. It was also used as the title of Philip Norman's Beatles biography, ''[[Shout!]]''.\n\n{{TMCP Song|shout}}"}}}]}}}}
