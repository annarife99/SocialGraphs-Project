sunrise last morning cloudburst last day seems love left warning always going grey things must pass things must pass away sunset last evening mind blow clouds away love must leaving always going grey things must pass things must pass away things must pass none lifes strings last must way face another day darkness stays nighttime morning fade away daylight good arriving right time always going grey things must pass things must pass away things must pass things must pass away
