Yes, I'm lonely wanna die.  Yes, I'm lonely wanna die.  If I ain't dead already, ooh,  girl, you know the reason why.   In the morning, wanna die.  In the evening, wanna die.  If I ain't dead already, ooh,  girl, you know the reason why.   My mother was of the sky.  My father was of the earth.  But I am of the universe  and you know what that's worth.   I'm lonely, wanna die.  If I ain't dead already, ooh,  girl, you know the reason why.   The eagle picks my eye.  The worm he licks my bones.  I feel so suicidal  just like Dylan's Mister Jones.   Lonely, wanna die.  If I ain't dead already, ooh,  girl, you know the reason why.   Black clouds cross'd my mind.  Blue mist round my soul,  I feel so suicidal  even hate my rock and roll,   Wanna die. Yeah, wanna die.  If I ain't dead already, ooh,  girl, you know the reason why.
