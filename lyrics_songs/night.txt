We said our goodbyes,  Love was in your eyes.  Now today I find you have changed your mind,   Treat me like you did the night before.  Were you telling lies?  Was I so unwise?   When I held you near you were so sincere,  Treat me like you did the night before.  Last night is the night I will remember you by;  When I think of things we did it makes me want to cry.
