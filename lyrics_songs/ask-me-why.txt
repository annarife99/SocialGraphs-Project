I love you,   Cause you tell me things I want to know,   And it's true that it really only goes to show   That I know that I-I-I-I should never, never, never be blue.    Now you're mine,   My happiness still makes me cry.   And in time you'll understand the reasons why   If I cry it's not because I'm sad   But you're the only love that I've ever had.    I can't believe it's happened to me.   I can't conceive of any more misery.   Ask me why   I'll say I love you and I'm always thinking of you.
