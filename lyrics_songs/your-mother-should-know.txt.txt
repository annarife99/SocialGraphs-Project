Let's all get up and dance to a song that was a hit  Before your mother was born.  Though she was born a long, long time ago,  Your mother should know, your mother should know.  Sing it again:  Let's all get up and dance to a song that was a hit  Before your mother was born.  Though she was born a long, long time ago,  Your mother should know, your mother should know.    Lift up your hearts and sing me a song  That was a hit before your mother was born.  Though she was born a long, long time ago,  Your mother should know, your mother should know.  Your mother should know, your mother should know.   Sing it again:  Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.  Though she was born a long, long time ago,  Your mother should know, your mother should know.  Your mother should know, your mother should know.  Your mother should know, your mother should know.
