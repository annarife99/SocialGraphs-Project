I said I'm sittin' here watchin'  Matchbox hole in my clothes  I said I'm sittin' here watchin'  Matchbox hole in my clothes   I ain't got no matches  But I sure got a long way to go   I'm an ol' poor boy  And I'm a long way from home  I'm an ol' poor boy  And I'm a long way from home   I've never been happy  'Cause everything I ever did was wrong   Well if you don't my peaches honey  Please don't shake my tree  If you don't want any of those peaches honey  Please don't mess around my tree   I got news for you baby  Leave me here in misery  Alright   (Instrumental/solo)   Well let me be your little dog  'Til your big dog comes  Let me be your little dog  'Til your big dog comes   And when your big dog gets here  Watch how your puppy dog runs   Well I said I'm sittin' here watchin'  Matchbox hole in my clothes  I said I'm sittin' here watchin'  Matchbox hole in my clothes   I ain't got no matches  But I sure got a long way to go
