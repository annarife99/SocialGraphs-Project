You know you made me cry,  I see no use in wond'rin' why  I cried for you   And now you've changed your mind  I see no reason to change mine;  My cryin' is through, oh.   You're giving me the same old line,  I'm wond'ring why.  You hurt me then,  You're back again;  No, no no, not a second time!   You know you made me cry,  I see no use in wond'rin' why  I cried for you.   And now you've changed your mind  I see no reason to change mine;  My cryin' is through, oh.   You're giving me the same old line,  I'm wond'ring why.  You hurt me then,  You're back again;  No, no no, not a second time!   Not a second time,  Not a second time.
