When I call you up your line's engaged.  I have had enough, so act your age.  We have lost the time that was so hard to find;  And I will lose my mind  If you won't see me, (You won't see me.)  You won't see me. (You won't see me.)   I don't know ooh why you la la la should want ooh to hide, la la la  But I can't ooh get through la la la my hands ooh are tied, la la la  I won't want ooh to stay la la la I don't ooh have much to say, la la la  But I can turn ooh away la la la.  And you won't see me, (You won't see me.)  You won't see me. (You won't see me.)   Time after time you refuse to even listen,  I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing.   Though the days ooh are few la la la they're filled ooh with tears,la la la  And since I ooh lost you la la la it feels ooh like years, la la la  Yes it seems ooh so long la la la girl since ooh you've been gone, la la la  And I just can't ooh go on, la la la  If you won't see me, (You won't see me.)  You won't see me. (You won't see me.)   Time after time you refuse to even listen,  I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing.   Though the days ooh are few la la la they're filled ooh with tears,la la la  And since I ooh lost you la la la it feels ooh like years, la la la  Yes it seems ooh so long la la la girl since ooh you've been gone, la la la  And I just can't ooh go on, la la la  If you won't see me, (You won't see me.)  You won't see me. (You won't see me.)  Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la
