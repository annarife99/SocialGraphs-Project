Because you're sweet and lovely girl, I love you  Because you're sweet and lovely girl, it's true  I love you more than ever girl, I do   I want you in the morning girl, I love you  I want you at the moment I feel blue  I'm living every moment girl for you   Bop  Bop cat bop  Go Johnny go  Same ol' twelve bar blues   (Elmo James got nothin' on this, baby)   I loved you from the moment I saw you  You looked at me, that's all you had to do  I feel it now, I hope you feel it too   Because you're sweet and lovely girl, I love you  Because you're sweet and lovely girl, it's true  I love you more than ever girl, I do   I'm livin' the blues
