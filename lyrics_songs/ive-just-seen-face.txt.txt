I've just seen a face,  I can't forget the time or place where we just met.  She's just the girl for me  And I want all the world to see we've met.  Mm mm mm mm mm.   Had it been another day  I might have looked the other way  And I'd have never been aware,  But as it is I'll dream of her tonight,  Da da da da da da.   Falling, yes I am falling,  And she keeps calling me back again.   I have never known the like of this,  I've been alone and  I have missed things and kept out of sight,  For other girls were never quite like this,  Da da da da da da.   Falling, yes I am falling,  And she keeps calling me back again.   I've just seen a face,  I can't forget the time or place where we just met.
