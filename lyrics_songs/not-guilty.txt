Not guilty  Of getting in your way while you're trying to steal the day  Not guilty  And I'm not here for the rest, I'm not trying to steal your vest   I'm not trying to be smart, I only want what I can get  I'm really sorry for your aging head  But like you heard he said, I'm not guilty   Not guilty  For being on your street, getting underneath your feet  Not guilty  No use handing me a writ while I'm trying to do my bit   I don't expect to take your heart , I only want what I can get  I'm really sorry that you're underfed  But like you heard he said, I'm not guilty   Not guilty  For looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh  Not guilty  For leading you astray on the roads to Mandalay   I won't upset the apple cart, I only want what I can get  I'm really sorry that you've been misled  But like you heard he said, I'm not guilty
