I'm looking through you,  Where did you go?  I thought I knew you,  What did I know?   You don't look diff'rent,  But you have changed.  I'm looking through you,  You're not the same.   Your lips are moving,  I cannot hear,  Your voice is soothing,  But the words aren't clear.   You don't sound diff'rent,  I've learned the game.  I'm looking through you,  You're not the same.   Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?  Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight.   You're thinking of me  The same old way,  You were above me,  But not today.   The only diff'rence is you're down there.  I'm looking through you and you're nowhere.   Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?  Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight.   I'm looking through you,  Where did you go?  I thought I knew you,  What did I know?   You don't look diff'rent, but you have changed.  I'm looking through you, you're not the same.   Yeah! Well, baby, you've changed. Ah, I'm looking through you...
