Hello little girl  Hello little girl  Hello little girl   When I see you everyday  I say, mmm mmm, hello little girl  When you're passing on your way  I say, mmm mmm, hello little girl   When I see you passing by  I cry, mmm mmm, hello little girl  When I try to catch your eye  I cry, mmm mmm, hello little girl   I send you flowers  But you don't care  You never seem to see  Me standing there   I often wonder  What you're thinking of  I hope it's me  And love, love, love   So I hope there'll come a day  When you'll say, mmm mmm  You're my little girl   It's not the first time  That it's happened to me  It's been a long, lonely time  And it's so funny, funny to see  That I'm about to lose my mi-mi-mind   So I hope there'll come a day  When you'll say, mmm mmm  You're my little girl, mmm mmm mmm  You're my little girl, mmm mmm mmm  You're my little girl, oh yeah  You're my little girl
