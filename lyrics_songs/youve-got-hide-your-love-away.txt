Here I stand, head in hand,  turn my face to the wall.  If she's gone, I can't go on,  feeling two foot small.   Ev'rywhere people stare,  each and ev'ryday.  I can see them laugh at me,  and I hear them say:   Hey! You've got to hide your love away.  Hey! You've got to hide your love away.   How can I even try?  I can never win.  Hearing them, seeing them,  In the state I'm in.   How could she say to me  Love will find a way?  Gather 'round all you clowns,  Let me hear you say:   Hey! You've got to hide your love away.  Hey! You've got to hide your love away.
