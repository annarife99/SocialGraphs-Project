I've got to admit, it's getting better,  A little better all the time.  I have to admit, it's getting better,  It's getting better since you've been mine.

Better, Better, Better   I used to be cruel to my woman,  I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved.  Man, I was mean, but I'm changing my scene,  And I'm doing the best that I can.   I admit, it's getting better, a little better all the time.
