When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide,  Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride,  Till I get to the bottom, and I see you again,  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!   But do you, don't you, want me to love you?  I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you.   Tell me, tell me, tell me,  Come on, tell me the answer.  Well, you may be a lover,  But you ain't no dancer.   Now Helter Skelter,  Helter Skelter,  Helter Skelter,  Yeah!   Well will you, won't you want me to make you?  I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you.  Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer.  You may be a lover,  But you ain't no dancer.   Look out! Helter Skelter,  Helter Skelter,  Helter Skelter, ooh.   Look out! 'Cause here she comes!   When I get to the bottom  I go back to the top of the slide,  And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride,  And I get to the bottom, and I see you again,  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!   Well, do you, don't you want me to make you?  I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you.  Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer.  You may be a lover,  But you ain't no dancer.   Look out! Helter Skelter,  Helter Skelter,  Helter Skelter, ooh.   (Shout, ad lib:)  Look out!  Helter Skelter!  She's coming down fast!  Yes, she is.
