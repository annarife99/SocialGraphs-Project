Look what you're doin'. I'm feeling blue and lonely  Would it be too much to ask of you  What you're doin' to me?   You got me runnin' and there's no fun in it.  Why should it be so much to ask of you  What you're doin' to me?   I've been waiting here for you  Wond'rin what you're gonna do.  And should you need a love that's true, it's me.   Please stop your lyin'. You got me cryin', girl.  Why should it be so much to ask of you  What you're doin' to me?   I've been waiting here for you  Wond'rin what you're gonna do.
