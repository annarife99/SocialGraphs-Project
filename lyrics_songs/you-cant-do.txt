I got something to say that might cause you pain;  If I catch you talkin' to that boy again,  I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat.  Because I've told you before:  Oh, you can't do that.   Well, it's the second time I've caught you talkin' to him;  Do I have to tell you one more time I think it's a sin.  I think I'll let you down and leave you flat  Because I've told you before:  Oh, you can't do that.   Ev'rybody's green,  'cause I'm the one who won your love.  But if they'd seen  You talkin' that way  They'd laugh in my face.   So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine,  I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind.
