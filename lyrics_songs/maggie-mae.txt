Oh Dirty Maggie Mae,  They have taken her away  And she'll never walk down Lime Street anymore.   Oh, the judge, he guilty found her  Of robbin' the homeward bounder,  That dirty, no good, robbin' Maggie Mae.   'Tis the part of Liverpool  She returned me to.  Two pound ten a week,  That was my pay.
