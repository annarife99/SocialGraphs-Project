I want a love that's right, right is only half of what's wrong  I want a short-haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long  Now I'm steppin' out this old brown shoe  Baby I'm in love with you  I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now I'm telling you   Though you pick me up from where some try to drag me down  And when I see your smile replacing every thoughtless frown  So escaping from this zoo  Baby I'm in love with you  I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you   If I grow up I'll be a singer  Wearing rings on ev'ry finger  Not worrying what they or you'll say  I'll live and love and maybe some day  Who knows baby you may comfort me - hey!   (Instrumental/solo)   I may appear to be imperfect  My love is something you can't reject  I'm changing faster than the weather  If you and me should get together  Who knows baby, you may comfort me   I know my love is yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate  I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late  For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue  Baby I'm in love with you  I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you   I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you   Yeah, yeah, yeah   Tu la Tu ru tu  (repeat to fade)
