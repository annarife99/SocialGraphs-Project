My baby says she's trav'lling on the one after Nineonine.  I said move over honey, I'm travelling on that line.  I said move over once, move over twice,  Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice.  'Said you're trav'lling on the one after Nineonine.   I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knee.  You're only foolin' 'round, only foolin' 'round with me.  I said move over once, move over twice,  Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice.  'Said you're trav'llin' on the one after Nineonine.   Pick up my bags,  Run to the station.  Railman says,  "You've got the wrong location."   Pick up my bag,  Run right home.  Then I find  I've got the number wrong,   'Said you're trav'llin' on the one after Nineonine.
