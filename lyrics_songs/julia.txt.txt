Half of what I say is meaningless,  But I say it just to reach you, Julia, Julia  Julia, ocean child, calls me.   So I sing a song of love, Julia  Julia seashell eyes,  Windy smile, calls me.  So I sing a song of love, Julia.   Her hair of floating sky is shimmering,  Glimmering,  In the sun.   Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me.  So I sing a song of love, Julia   When I cannot sing my heart,  I can only speak my mind, Julia  Julia sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me.   So I sing a song of love, Julia.  Mmm calls me.  So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia.
