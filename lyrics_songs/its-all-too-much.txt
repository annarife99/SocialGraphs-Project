It's all too much   It's all too much   When I look into your eyes   Your love is there for me   And the more I go inside   The more there is to see.   It's all too much for me to take   The love that's shining all around you   Everywhere it's what you make for us to take, it's all too much   Floating down the stream of time   From life to life with me   Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be.   It's all too much for me to take   The love that's shining all around here.   All the world is birthday cake so take a piece but not too much.   Sail me on a silver sun   Where I know that I'm free   Show me that I'm everywhere and get me home for tea.   It's all too much for me to see  A love that's shining all around here  The more I learn, the less I know  And what I do is all too much  It's all too much for me to take  A love that's shining all around you  Everywhere it's what you make for us to take it's all too much.   It's too much, it's too much.   ...with your long blond hair and your eyes of blue  Too much, too much, too much
