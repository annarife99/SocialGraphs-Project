Martha my dear,  Though I spend my days in conversation,  Please remember me.   Martha my love,  Don't forget me,  Martha my dear.   Hold your head up,  You silly girl,  Look what you've done.  When you find yourself in the thick of it,  Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you, silly girl.   Take a good look around you,  Take a good look, you're bound to see  That you and me  Were meant to be  For each other, silly girl.   Hold your hand out,  You silly girl,  See what you've done.  When you find yourself in the thick of it,  Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you, silly girl.   Martha my dear,  You have always been my inspiration,  Please be good to me.   Martha my love,  Don't forget me,  Martha my dear.
