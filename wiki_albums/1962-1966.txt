It was released with ''[[1967-1970]]'' (''The Blue Album''), a compilation of their greatest hits from 1967 to 1970. ''1962\u20131966'' reached #3 in the UK and managed to reach #1 in the U.S. Cashbox albums chart. However, in the U.S. the official chart was administered by Billboard, where ''1962\u20131966'' peaked at #3, while ''[[1967-1970]]'' managed to meet the summit. This album was re-released in September 1993 charting at #3 in the UK, this album was re-released again but this time, it was in remastered form, on the 19th of October, 2010, (in some locations, for example, Nottingham, it took till the 22nd of October, for it to hit the shelves) at the same time as the ''[[1967-1970]]'' Album.\n\nThe album was compiled by Beatles manager [[Allen Klein]], with his selections approved by the Beatles themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Badman|first=Keith|title=The Beatles: Off the Record|publisher=Omnibus Press|date=2002|pages=99|isbn=0711991995}}</ref> Even though the group had had success with cover versions of songs, most notably with \"[[Twist and Shout]]\", which made #2 on the Billboard charts, only songs composed by The Beatles themselves were included.\n\nIt is recognised as the first Beatles compilation since their breakup on 31 December 1970. Both it and ''1967\u20131970'' were produced by [[Apple Records|Apple]]/[[EMI]] at least partially in response to a bootleg compilation titled ''[[Alpha Omega]]'', which had been sold on television the previous year.\n\n==Album covers==\nFor the group's 1963 debut LP ''[[Please Please Me (album)|Please Please Me]]'', photographer [[Angus McBean]] was asked to take the distinctive colour photograph of the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI House ([[EMI]]'s London headquarters in Manchester Square, now demolished).\n\nIn 1969, The Beatles asked McBean to recreate this shot. Although the 1969 photograph was originally intended for the then-planned ''Get Back'' album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]''. Instead, the 1969 photograph, along with an unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot, was used for both this LP and ''[[1967-1970|The Beatles 1967-1970]]''.\n\nThe inner gatefold photo for both LPs is from the \"Mad Day Out\" photo session, London, 28 July 1968.\n\n==Release variations==\n*Original 1973 release: Apple SKBO-3403 (whole and sliced apples on red background)\n*Second pressings: Capitol SKBO-3403 (Capitol target logo on back of album cover, red labels with \"Capitol\" in light red at bottom. There are also copies erroneously pressed with the BLUE labels for the 1967\u20131970 pressings.)\n*First red vinyl issue: Capitol SEBX-11842 (Capitol dome logo on back of album cover, large dome logo at top of labels)\n\nThe British and American versions of the vinyl album contain notable differences; for example, \"[[Help! (song)|Help!]]\" on the American edition includes the same \"James Bond Intro\" as the mix found on the American ''Help!'' [[Help! (album)#United States release|soundtrack LP]], while the same song on the British edition does not. Also, the British LP uses the stereo \"whispering intro\" mix of \"[[I Feel Fine]],\" while the US LP uses the mix from ''[[Beatles '65]]'', which is the duophonic mix drenched in reverb. ''(See Mix Variations below.)''\n\nThe Compact Disc version was released on two discs for the price of two albums, though it could have fit on to a single disc; [[EMI]] stated that this was done to match the release of ''1967\u20131970''. The CD version used new digital masters. The first four tracks on the CD release are in mono; the rest of the tracks are in stereo. The tracks \"[[All My Loving]]\", \"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\", \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\", \"[[And I Love Her]]\" and \"[[Eight Days a Week]]\" made their CD stereo debut with this release.\n\n==Track listing==\n*Although it appeared on the [[Vee Jay Records|Vee Jay]] compilation ''Jolly What! the Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage'', this is the first appearance of \"From Me to You\" on a U.S. Capitol album.\n*\"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\" also makes its U.S. Capitol album debut here, previously only featured on the United Artists soundtrack album.\n*All tracks written by [[Lennon/McCartney]].\n\n;Side one\n#\"[[Love Me Do]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:23\n#\"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:03\n#\"[[From Me to You]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 1:57\n#\"[[She Loves You]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:22\n#\"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:26\n#\"[[All My Loving]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:08\n#\"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:13\n\n;Side two\n#\"[[A Hard Day's Night]]\"&nbsp;- 2:28\n#\"[[And I Love Her]]\"&nbsp;- 2:28\n#\"[[Eight Days a Week]]\"&nbsp;- 2:43\n#\"[[I Feel Fine]]\"&nbsp;- 2:20\n#\"[[Ticket to Ride]]\"&nbsp;- 3:03\n#\"[[Yesterday]]\"&nbsp;- 2:04\n\n;Side three\n#\"[[Help!]]\"&nbsp;- 2:35\n#\"[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]]\"&nbsp;- 2:08\n#\"[[We Can Work It Out]]\"&nbsp;- 2:10\n#\"[[Day Tripper]]\"&nbsp;- 2:47\n#\"[[Drive My Car]]\"&nbsp;- 2:25\n#\"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\"&nbsp;- 2:00\n\n;Side four\n#\"[[Nowhere Man]]\"&nbsp;- 2:40\n#\"[[Michelle]]\"&nbsp;- 2:42\n#\"[[In My Life]]\"&nbsp;- 2:23\n#\"[[Girl]]\"&nbsp;- 2:26\n#\"[[Paperback Writer]]\"&nbsp;- 2:14\n#\"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\"&nbsp;- 2:11\n#\"[[Yellow Submarine]]\"&nbsp;- 2:37\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Albums}}\n[[Category:Albums]]\n[[Category:Compilation albums]]\n[[Category:Post break-up albums]]"}}}]}}}}
