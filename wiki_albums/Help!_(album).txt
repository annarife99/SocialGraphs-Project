It was first released on 6 August 1965 in the United Kingdom by [[Parlophone]] and on 13 August in the United States by [[Capitol Records]]. Produced by [[George Martin]], it serves as a soundtrack to the [[Help! (film)|film of the same name]] and contains fourteen songs in its original British release. Seven of these, including the singles \"[[Help! (song)|Help!]]\" and \"[[Ticket to Ride]]\", appeared in the film and occupy the first side of the vinyl release; the second side contained seven other songs, including the wildly popular cover song \"[[Yesterday]]\". The album's cover artwork shows the band spelling out letters in flag semaphore; Robert Freeman, the photographer, said he originally intended to have them spell out the album title, but decided to choose the \"best graphic positioning of the arms\", where they instead spell out the letters \"NUJV\".\n\nThe American release of the album is considered more of a genuine soundtrack, mixing the first seven songs with instrumental material from the film. Of the other seven songs on the British release, two were released on the American issue of the next Beatles album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', two were back-to-back on the next US single and appeared on ''[[Yesterday and Today]]'', and three had already appeared on ''[[Beatles VI]]''.\n\n== Music ==\nThe album includes Paul McCartney's \"Yesterday\", arranged for guitar and string quartet and recorded without the other group members. John Lennon's \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" indicates the influence of Bob Dylan and includes flutes. McCartney's \"I've Just Seen a Face\" had a country flavour.\n\n\"Ticket to Ride\", released as a single in April 1965, was felt by Lennon to be \"heavy\" in its sound compared to the group's previous output and daring in its reference to a boy and girl living together. McCartney called the arrangement \"quite radical\". During the recording sessions for the album, the band used the studio's multitracking capabilities to layer their sound. In this, author Mark Prendergast highlights George Harrison's use of a volume pedal and incorporation of \"more intricate chordal devices to enrich his guitar sound\".\n\nAs a songwriter, Harrison contributed \"I Need You\" and \"You Like Me Too Much\". These were his first compositions to be included on a Beatles album since \"Don't Bother Me\" on 1963's ''With the Beatles''.\n\nThe record contained two cover versions and a few tracks more closely related to the group's previous pop output, but still marked a decisive step forward. The record sleeve-note shows that Lennon and McCartney made more extensive and prominent use of keyboards, previously played unobtrusively by Martin. Four-track overdubbing technology encouraged this. Lennon, for his part, made much greater use of acoustic guitar, forsaking his famous Rickenbacker.\n\nThe original LP's format of featuring songs from the soundtrack on side one and non-soundtrack songs on side two follows the format of ''A Hard Day's Night''.\n\nIn later years, Lennon stated that the album's title track was a sincere cry for help; he regretted changing it from a downbeat, piano-driven ballad to an uptempo pop song, which was done only as a result of commercial pressures.\n\n''Help!'' was the band's final British album (aside from the late 1966 compilation ''A Collection of Beatles Oldies'') to feature any cover songs until 1970's ''Let It Be'' (which included a performance of the traditional folk song \"Maggie Mae\"). In 1966, Capitol would release \"Act Naturally\", already on the British ''Help!'' album, on ''Yesterday and Today''. \"Bad Boy\" and \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\" (both written by Larry Williams and recorded on 10 May 1965, Williams' birthday) were both aimed at the American market and originally not intended to appear on ''Help!'', but \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\" ultimately did. Both songs appeared on ''Beatles VI'', released in the US in June 1965. \"Bad Boy\" was not released in the UK until ''A Collection of Beatles Oldies'', and was that album's only cover song.\n\n=== Outtakes ===\nA few songs that were recorded and intended for the album and film were not used. Lennon and McCartney wrote \"If You've Got Trouble\" for Ringo Starr to sing, but the Beatles were not satisfied with the song and it was abandoned, and Starr sang \"Act Naturally\" instead. \"That Means a Lot\" was written for the film, but again, the Beatles were displeased with their recordings of the song and it was given to P.J. Proby who released it as a single. Lennon said \"Yes It Is\" was \"me trying a rewrite of 'This Boy', but it didn't work\"; it was released as the B-side of \"Ticket to Ride\" and was also issued on ''Beatles VI''. \"You Like Me Too Much\" and \"Tell Me What You See\" were turned down for use in the film by its director, Richard Lester, although they did appear on the album.\n\nIn June 1965, at the end of the ''Help!'' sessions, the song \"Wait\" was recorded for the album, but was left unfinished. The Beatles resurrected the track and completed it for inclusion on ''Rubber Soul'' in November, when a final song was needed to complete that album.\n\n==Tracks==\nAll songs were written by [[Lennon/McCartney]] except where noted.\n\n===Side one===\nAll songs on side one appear in the film.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"color:black; background:white; width:100%\"\n!

This album is available on CD as part of ''[[The Capitol Albums, Volume 2]]'' box set. This set also includes the mono version of the American release, which is purely a stereo-to-mono fold-down mix, including the \"fake stereo\" duophonic \"Ticket To Ride\" folded down to mono, despite Capitol already having the mono mixes for the single releases of both that song and \"Help!\". A second CD release of this album, which contained the seven songs in true mono was issued in 2014 individually and part of the Beatles' ''[[The U.S. Albums]]'' boxed set.\n\nThe American version of \"Help!\" reached the number one spot on the Billboard album charts for nine weeks starting on 11 September 1965.\n\n==Tracks==\n===Side one===\n#\"[[Help!
