The album marked a departure from the ebullient tone that characterised the band's previous work, partly due to their exhaustion from a series of tours that established them as a worldwide phenomenon. Musically, it introduced darker moods and more introspective lyrics, with songwriter [[John Lennon]] adopting an autobiographical perspective on songs such as \"[[I'm a Loser]]\" and \"[[No Reply]]\". It also reflected the twin influences of country music and Bob Dylan, whom the Beatles met in New York in August 1964.\n\n''Beatles for Sale'' was recorded at London's EMI Studios in between the band's touring and radio engagements. Partly as a result of their hectic schedule, only eight tracks are original compositions, with cover songs being used to complete the track listing; the sessions also produced the non-album single \"[[I Feel Fine]]\", backed by \"[[She's a Woman]]\". Eight of the album's fourteen tracks appeared on [[Capitol Records]]' concurrent release ''[[Beatles '65]]'', issued in North America only.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, ''Beatles for Sale'' held the top spot for eleven of the 46 weeks it spent within the top 20. The album was not released in the United States until 1987, when the Beatles' catalogue was standardised for release on CD. ''Beatles for Sale'' was certified gold by the [[Wikipedia:British Phonographic Industry|British Phonographic Industry]] for shipments of over 100,000 copies, and platinum by the [[Wikipedia:Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America]] for shipments of over 1 million copies.\n\n==Tracks==\nAll songs written by [[Lennon/McCartney]], except where noted otherwise.\n\n===Side one===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"color:black; background:white; width:100%\"\n!
