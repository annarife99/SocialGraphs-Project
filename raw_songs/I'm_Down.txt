It was written by [[Paul McCartney]], and credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]] and first released as the B-Side to ''[[Help! (song)|Help!]]'' in [[1965]]. It has been covered several times, most notably by Aerosmith. The song is a tribute to 1950s music, and is seen by many as a rewrite of Little Richard's \"Long Tall Sally,\" one of The Beatles' favourite cover songs. A slower version of the song without backing vocals is on \"Anthology 2.\" (?)\n\n==Credits==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 Lead and Backing Vocals, Bass Guitar ([[Hofner 500/1]])\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 Vox Continental, Rhythm Guitar ([[Rickenbacker 325]])?, Backing Vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 Lead and possibly Rhythm Guitar ([[Grestch Tennessean]]), Backing Vocals\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 Drums, Bongos\n\n{{song stub}}\n[[Category:B-sides]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Anthology 2]]\n[[Category:1965 songs]]\n[[Category:Non-album singles]]"}}}]}}}}
