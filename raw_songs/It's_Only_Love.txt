The lyrics were abysmal. I always hated that song.\"<ref name=\"Beatles Bible\"/>\n\nIn his 1994 biography ''[[Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now]]'', McCartney said of the song: \"Sometimes we didn't fight it if the lyric came out rather bland on some of those filler songs like 'It's Only Love'. If a lyric was really bad we'd edit it, but we weren't that fussy about it, because it's only a rock 'n' roll song. I mean, this is not literature.\"<ref name=\"Beatles Bible\"/>\n\n==Recording==\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"It's Only Love\" on 15 June 1965. They recorded six takes of the rhythm track, although two of these were incomplete.
