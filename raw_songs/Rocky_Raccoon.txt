It was included on [[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]. It was written primarily by Paul McCartney and credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]].\n\n==Composition==\n\nThe song was written whilst the Beatles were on retreat (in Maharishi's camp in India, the Beatles went there in 1968 to study transcendental meditation) by Paul McCartney. The song is in the key of C Major, with an 8-bar chord progression, (AM7, D7sus4, D7, G7, C and C/B) which runs throughout.\n\nMcCartney told ''Mojo'' about the song: \"Rocky was me writing (speaks-sings in a baccy-chewing old prospector voice), 'It was way back in the hills of Dakota-or Arkansas-in the mining days. And it was tough, picking shovels, and we were underground 24 hours a day\u2026' I could have taken this serious route, researched it- Take This Hammer (a prison work song recorded by British skiffle star Lonnie Donegan in 1959), stuff I'd been brought up on. But at that point I was a little tongue-in cheek. So I crossed it with a (British singer and banjo player popular in the 1940s) George Formby sensibility, where John and I would go (sings a bit of doggerel in a choppy rhythm)- Stanley Holloway, Albert in The Lion's Den (the comic poem The Lion and Albert, written by Holloway's creative partner Marriott Edgar in 1932). We were very versed in all that stuff (sings opening lines of Rocky Raccoon in the same choppy way). The scanning of the poetical stanza always interested me. Somehow this little story unfolded itself. I was basically spoofing 'the folk-singer.' And it included [[wikipedia:Gideon's Bible|Gideon's Bible]], which I've seen in every hotel I've ever been in. You open the drawer and there it is! Who's this guy Gideon! I still don't know to this day who the heck he is. I'm sure he's a very well-meaning guy. Rocky Raccoon was a freewheeling thing, the fun of mixing a folky ramble with Albert In The Lion's Den with its ''orse's 'ead 'andle,' ha ha.\"''\n\n== Credits ==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2014 lead and backing vocals, acoustic guitar (Martin D28) \n*[[John Lennon]] \u2014 backing vocals, harmonica, six-string bass guitar (1968 [[Fender Bass VI]])\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2014 backing vocals\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2014 drums\n*[[George Martin]] \u2014 honky-tonk piano (''1964 Challen \u201cJangle Box\u201d upright) ''\n\n==Related video==\n[[File:Why are There Bibles in Hotel Rooms?|left|600px|Explanation of \"Gideon's Bible\" and its origin]]\n{{Song stub}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/rocky-raccoon/the-beatles Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on The White Album]]"}}}]}}}}
