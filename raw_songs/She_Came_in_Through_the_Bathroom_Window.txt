Jessica Samuels, one of the group, says: \"We were bored, he was out and so we decided to pay him a visit. We found a ladder in his garden and stuck it up at the bathroom window which he'd left slightly open. I was the one who climbed up and got in.\" She then opened the front door to let the others in, and they stole a number of photographs. Another Apple scruff, Margo Bird, remembers being good friends with McCartney \u2014 she would often take his dog for walks \u2014 and later got a job at [[Apple Corps]]. She says that she was asked to retrieve a certain photograph, which she did.\n\nIn the 2006 DVD documentary ''The Classic Artists Series: The Moody Blues'' (DVD UK, released October 2006), Mike Pinder, the former keyboard player of Birmingham R&B band The Moody Blues, states that the inspiration for the song actually rests with an incident that happened to them \u2014 a groupie climbing into an open bathroom window in the band's home and spending the night with band member Ray Thomas. The next day, Pinder and Thomas recounted the story to McCartney, who \u2014 guitar in hand \u2014 strummed and sang \"She came in through the bathroom window...\".\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Intro]\n\n(Oh, listen to that now!)\n\n(Ha ha ha)\n\n(Wow look out)\n\n(She...)\n\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nShe came in through the bathroom window\n\nProtected by a silver spoon\n\nBut now she sucks her thumb and wonders\n\nBy the banks of her own lagoon\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nDidn't anybody tell her?\n\nDidn't anybody see?\n\nSunday's on the phone to Monday\n\nTuesday's on the phone to me\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nShe said she'd always been a dancer\n\nShe worked at fifteen clubs a day\n\nAnd though she thought I knew the answer\n\nWell, I knew what I could not say\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nAnd so I quit the police department\n\nAnd got myself a steady job\n\nAnd though she tried her best to help me\n\nShe could steal, but she could not rob\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nDidn't anybody tell her?\n\nDidn't anybody see?\n\nSunday's on the phone to Monday\n\nTuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah\n\n==Recording==\nThe Beatles recorded the rhythm track for this and Polythene Pam as one piece on 25 July 1969. It took them 39 attempts, after which they added lead vocals and re-recorded the drums and bass guitar parts.\n\nOn 28 July they added more vocals, guitar, percussion and piano.
