The album version is the live performance from the rooftop concert which took place on 30 January 1969. This performance is also included in the [[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]] film. The song was written as early as 1957, and is one of the first Lennon-McCartney compositions.\n\nThe Beatles originally attempted to record the song on 5 March 1963 during the same session that produced their third single, \"[[From Me to You]]\", and its B-side \"[[Thank You Girl]]\". They were unhappy with the result and that version was not released at the time. Various takes from the 5 March session, and an edit of them, were released in 1995 on the [[Anthology 1]] compilation. Episode 1 of the Beatles Anthology features a recording of the song made in 1960.\n\n\"One After 909\" is included on 2003's [[Let It Be... Naked]], a remixed and remastered version of the original 1970 session tapes.\n\nEach version of the song is representative of the Beatles changing styles, with the 1963 recording based on a simple 12-bar structure with few lead parts other than [[George Harrison]]'s solo in the middle. The 1969 recording is much faster and heavier, with Harrison playing lead riffs throughout.\n\nOn the rooftop version released on Let It Be, either Harrison or Lennon plays an incorrect first note, resulting in an flat, atonal start. This was one of the many errors corrected for Let It Be... Naked.\n\nAlso on the Let It Be version of this song, Lennon is heard singing the opening lines to \"Danny Boy\" as the song fades out.\n==Credits==\n* [[John Lennon]] - lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]])\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - backing vocals, bass (1963 [[Hofner 500/1]])\n* [[George Harrison]] - lead guitar (1968 [[Fender Telecaster]])\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - drums\n* [[Billy Preston]] - piano (1965 [[Fender Rhodes]])\n{{Wikipedia|One After 909}}\n{{song stub}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/one-after-909/let-it-be Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Meet The Beatles]]"}}}]}}}}
