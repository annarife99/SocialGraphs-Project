It was written by [[Paul McCartney]], with help from [[John Lennon]], and credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]]. Leonard Bernstein praised the song for its construction in a 1967 CBS News documentary. Richie Unterberger of allmusic said the song \"radiates optimism and good vibes\" and [[Ian MacDonald]] said it is \"superbly sung by McCartney and exquisitely produced by [[George Martin]] and his team\" and \"displays The Beatles at their effortless best.\"\n==Recording==\nThe song was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] 8 June 1966, with overdubs added the following day. McCartney sang the lead vocal and also played bass guitar and piano accompanied by [[Ringo Starr]] on drums. Music critic [[Ian MacDonald]] was unsure if [[John Lennon]] played guitar on the track; in his description of the recording sessions for the song, Mark Lewisohn did not mention a guitar track. It's most likely the guitar track was wiped afterwards.\n\nLennon and [[George Harrison]] add harmony vocals during the choruses. [[George Martin]] played the piano solo, recorded with the tape recorder running slower than usual; thus in the released version the solo sounds faster than it was actually played.\n\nLike \"[[She Said She Said]]\" the song closes with an imitative canon in the voices.\n==Influences and cover version==\nMcCartney said that he was influenced by The Lovin' Spoonful: the song's \"old-timey vaudevillian feel\" particularly recalls the Spoonful's big hit \"Daydream\" to which it also shows some harmonic resemblance.\n\nClaudine Longet recorded a version in 1967 for her album ''The Look of Love'' and also released it as a single. The single peaked at #100 on Billboard's Hot 100 Chart and #36 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Chart.\n==Cultural references==\n*\"Good Day Sunshine\" has been played as the wake-up music on multiple Space Shuttle missions. McCartney played the song live to the crew of the International Space Station on 13 November 2005 in the first-ever concert link-up to the space station.\n*The song is also played at Safeco Field, home of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners, when the retractable roof is retracted.\n==Credits==\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 Lead Vocals, Piano, Handclaps\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 Harmony Vocals, Guitar ([[Epiphone 230TD Casino]]), Handclaps\n* [[George Harrison]] - Harmony Vocals, Bass Guitar (Burns Nu-Sonic), Handclaps\n* [[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 Drums, Handclaps\n* [[George Martin]] \u2013 Piano\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on Revolver]]\n\n[[Category:1966 songs]]"}}}]}}}}
