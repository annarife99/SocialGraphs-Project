It was picked up by [[George Martin]], who recognised that it was a potential number 1 single; Martin offered it to [[the Beatles]], who dutifully recorded it (after making a few tweaks), but decided that it didn't suit their style, so Martin handed it instead to Gerry and the Pacemakers, and it became their debut single, reaching number 1.\n\nNOTE : The demo of How Do You Do It that was played to the Beatles by Martin was recorded by The Dave Clark Five (with vocals by Murray).\n\nThe Beatles' version was eventually released on ''[[Anthology 1]]''.\n\n{{TMCP Song|how-do-you-do-it}}\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[John Lennon]]: Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar (1958 Rickenbacker 325)\n* [[Paul McCartney]]: Lead and Backing Vocals, Bass Guitar (1961 Hofner 500/1)\n* [[George Harrison]]: Backing Vocals, Lead Guitar (1957 Gretsch Duo Jet)\n* [[Ringo Starr]]: Drums\n\n==External links==\n\n*[https://www.the-paulmccartney-project.com/song/how-do-you-do-it/ \"How Do You Do It?\"] on the [[Paul McCartney Project]]\n{{stub}}\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]"}}}]}}}}
