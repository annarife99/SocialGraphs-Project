Darling''' is a song of The Beatles composed by [[Paul McCartney]] (credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]]) and appearing as the fourth song on the [[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road album]] in 1969. Its working title was \"Oh! Darling (I'll Never Do You No Harm)\".\n\nMcCartney later said of recording the track, \"When we were recording 'Oh! Darling' I came into the studios early every day for a week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear. I wanted it to sound as though I'd been performing it on stage all week.\" He would only try the song once each day,if it was not right he would wait until the next day. In order to make sure he got every precious first take right, McCartney would practice the song in the bathtub. He once lamented that \"five years ago I could have done this in one take\".\n\nIn a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine, [[John Lennon]] said, \"'Oh! Darling' was a great one of Paul's that he didn't sing too well. I always thought I could have done it better\u2014it was more my style than his. He wrote it, so what the hell, he's going to sing it.\"\n\n[[George Harrison]] described the song as \"a typical 1950s-'60s-period song because of its chord structure.\"\n\nAfter an early attempt at this song on 27 January 1969 during the [[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]] sessions, Lennon announced, \"Just heard that [[Yoko Ono|Yoko]]'s divorce has just gone through\", after which he and the band burst into an improvised version of the song, substituting \"I'm free at last\" for a part of the lyric. The song and the following improvisation are included on [[The Beatles]] [[Anthology 3]] CD.\n\nThe basic track was recorded on 20 April 1969, but there were many overdub sessions, including multiple attempts at the lead vocal by McCartney (as described above). According to Ian MacDonald, the backing vocals were \"exquisite\", but \"sadly underplayed in the mix.\" The line up from the 50th Anniversary of Abbey Road states Paul on Piano, John on Guitar, George on Bass and Ringo on Drums. Billy Preston played an Organ in this session that was unused in the final mix\n==Lyrics==\n<poem>\nOh!
