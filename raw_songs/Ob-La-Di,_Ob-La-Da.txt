It was released as a single that same year in many countries, but not in the United Kingdom, nor in the United States until 1976.\n\n==Composition==\nThe song was written, primarily by [[Paul McCartney]] , around the time that highlife and reggae were beginning to become popular in Britain. The tag line \"ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra\" was an expression that Nigerian conga player Jimmy Scott-Emuakpor, an acquaintance of McCartney, used. The song is in the key of B flat and written in 4/4.\n[[File:Obladiobladasingle.jpg|thumb|Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Di Single]]\n==Recording==\nDuring May 1968, The Beatles gathered at [[George Harrison]]'s Esher home, in Surrey, to record demos for their upcoming project. \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" was one of the twenty-seven demos recorded there. Paul performed this demo solo, with only an acoustic guitar. He had also double-tracked his vocal, which was not perfectly synchronised, creating an echoing effect.\n\nAccording to studio engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], [[John Lennon]] openly hated the song, calling it \"Paul's granny shit\". Lennon left the studio during a recording of the song (after several days and literally dozens of takes of the song, trying different tempos and styles), then returned while under the influence of marijuana, went immediately to the piano and played the opening chords much louder and faster than before. He claimed that was how the song should be played, and that is the version they ended up using.\n\nWhen singing the vocals for the song, specifically the last verse of the song when sung the second time, McCartney made a slip and said \"Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face\", rather than Molly, and had Molly letting \"the children lend a hand\". Reportedly, this mistake was kept in because the other Beatles liked it. [[George Harrison]] and Lennon yell \"arm\" and \"leg\" during a break in the song; between the lines \"..Desmond lets the children lend a hand\" and \"Molly stays at home...\"\n\nDesmond Dekker later covered the song as part of a medley with \"Wise Man\".\n\nThe lyrics for \"[[Savoy Truffle]]\", composed by Harrison and also on ''The Beatles'', include the line \"We all know ob-la-di-bla-da, but can you show me where you are.\"\n==Releases and live performances==\n\n\n\nOb-La-Di, Ob-la-Da\" was released on ''The Beatles'' on 22 November 1968. In the USA, in 1976, it was released as a single with \"[[Julia]]\" as the B-side. An alternative version, known as \"Take 5\", was released on ''[[Anthology 3]]'' in which the horns are much more prominent.\n\nThe first time the song was performed live by any of The Beatles was on 2 December 2009, when McCartney played the song in Hamburg, Germany on the first night of a European tour. McCartney also performed the song in Hyde Park on 27 June 2010 as part of the Hard Rock Calling event, and the song was well received by the crowd. He also added it as a number in the Latin American Leg of the Up and Coming Tour.\n==Reception==\nThe song was well received, going to number one in singles charts in Austria, Switzerland, Australia and Japan. In the UK and Norway (where it had not been released as a single by The Beatles), a cover version by the Marmalade also made number one.\n==Authorship dispute\ufeff==\nScott later tried to claim a writer's credit for the use of his catch phrase in the song; McCartney however, claimed that the phrase was \"just an expression\". Scott argued it was not a general expression, but merely an expression that was exclusively used in the Scott-Emuakpor family. However, he agreed to drop the case when McCartney agreed to pay Scott's legal expenses for an unrelated issue.\n\n==Credits==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] - Lead Vocals, Bass Guitar (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Acoustic Lead Guitar (1967 [[Martin D-28]]), Handclaps, Vocal Percussion\n\n*[[John Lennon]] - Tack Piano (1905 Steinway Vertegrand) or (1964 Challen Upright), Backing Vocals, Handclaps, Vocal Percussion\n\n*[[George Harrison]] - Acoustic Rhythm Guitar (1968 [[Gibson J-200]]), Backing Vocals, Handclaps\n\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - Drums, Bongos, Maracas, Congas, Claves, Marimba?, Handclaps\n\n*Session Musicians -Three Saxophones\n\n==Cover versions==\n*Marmalade, whose version reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1969.
