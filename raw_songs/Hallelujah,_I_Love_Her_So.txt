The rhythm and blues song was written and released by Charles in 1956 on the Atlantic label, and in 1957 it was included on his self-titled debut LP, also released on Atlantic. The song peaked at number five on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart. It is loosely based on 'Get It Over Baby' by Ike Turner (1953).{{Clear}}\"Hallelujah I Love Her So\" is a testament to the joyous release of love, featuring a sophisticated horn arrangement and memorable tenor sax solo by Don Wilkerson. Several artists, including Stevie Wonder, Peggy Lee, Eddie Cochran, and Humble Pie have successfully covered the song.\n\n== The Beatles version ==\nAccording to biographer Mark Lewisohn (in ''The Complete Beatles Chronicle'', p. 362), [[the Beatles]] (first as [[the Quarrymen]]) regularly performed the song, from at least 1960 through 1962 with [[Paul McCartney]] on lead vocal. A very early home recording rehearsal (dated tentatively to May 1960) of it was included on ''[[Anthology 1]]'' as well as on previous unauthorized releases. They continued playing it regularly including at The Star-Club in Hamburg through the end of 1962, an audience recording was made there which is included in the album ''Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962''. Additionally according to author Doug Sulpy (in ''Drugs, Divorce And A Slipping Image'', sec. 22.25) on Jan. 22, 1969 during the massive ''Get Back'' sessions they cut a version with [[John Lennon]] doing a \"loose\" lead vocal of it, that version has never been officially released. Lastly, in December 1961 the two singer-musicians that were asked to join the Beatles, namely Tony Sheridan and Roy Young, did a studio version that was released on the Sheridan album ''My Bonnie'' (1962) although none of the Beatles participate."}}}]}}}}
