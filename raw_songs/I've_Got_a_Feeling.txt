It is a combination of two unfinished songs strung together: [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"I've Got a Feeling\" and [[John Lennon]]'s \"Everybody Had a Hard Year\" from [[The White Album]] sessions (where it was demoed as \"Everyone Had a Hard Year\"), with the main guitar riff coming from Lennon's unfinished \"Watching Rainbows\". McCartney's song was written for his girlfriend Linda Eastman, whom he soon married, telling her that she was the girl he had always been looking for. Lennon's song was a litany where every line started with the word \"everybody\".\n\nWhile McCartney's song was very optimistic, Lennon had actually had a hard year\u2014he had divorced his wife, Cynthia Powell, was estranged from his son Julian Lennon, his girlfriend Yoko Ono had a miscarriage, he was arrested for drug possession, and he had grown deeply unhappy in the Beatles.\n\nIn the film [[Let It Be (film)]], Lennon claims jokingly he[John Lennon] wrote \"Everybody Had a Hard Year\" the night before.\n\n==Credits==\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Lead Vocals, Bass (1963 [[Hofner 500/1]])\n* [[John Lennon]] - Second Vocals, Rhythm guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]])\n* [[George Harrison]] - Lead Guitar (1968 [[Fender Telecaster|Fender Rosewood Telecaster]])\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - Drums (1968 Ludwig Hollywood Maple)\n* [[Billy Preston]] - piano (1965 Fender Rhodes Seventy-Three Sparkle Top)\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/i-ve-got-a-feeling/let-it-be Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]"}}}]}}}}
