It is known for being the second song [[Ringo Starr]] wrote for the Beatles.\n\nThe song was inspired by a boating trip he took in 1968\u00a0with his family, during which he learned the fact that octopuses are fond of collecting stones and shiny objects underwater, which they build \"gardens\" with. Ringo, who thought that an octopus's garden was one of the happiest things he'd heard, was inspired to write the song.\n\n==''Love'' version==\nThe version on the album ''[[Love (album)|Love]]'' (created by [[George Martin]] and his son, [[Giles Martin|Giles]], for {{w|Cirque du Soliel}}) has the strings from [[Good Night]], the sound effects/vocal elements from [[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]], guitar elements from [[Sun King]] (which had been used earlier as [[Gnik Nus]]) and some elements from [[Helter Skelter]] and [[Lovely Rita]]. It comes after [[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]] and transistions into [[Lady Madonna]].\n\n==Lyrics==\n''I'd like to be under the sea''\n\n''In an octopus's garden in the shade''\n\n''He'd let us in, knows where we've been''\n\n''In his octopus's garden in the shade''\n\n\n\n''I'd ask my friends to come and see''\n\n''An octopus's garden with me''\n\n''I'd like to be under the sea''\n\n''In an octopus's garden in the shade''\n\n\n''We would be warm below the storm''\n\n''In our little hideaway beneath the waves''\n\n''Resting our head on the sea bed''\n\n''In an octopus's garden near a cave''\n\n\n''We would sing and dance around''\n\n''Because we know we can't be found''\n\n''I'd like to be under the sea''\n\n''In an octopus's garden in the shade''\n\n\n''We would shout and swim about''\n\n''The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)''\n\n''Oh what joy for every girl and boy''\n\n''Knowing they're happy and they're safe (Happy and they're safe)''\n\n\n''We would be so happy you and me''\n\n''No one there to tell us what to do''\n\n''I'd like to be under the sea''\n\n''In an octopus's garden with you (3x)''\n\n==Credits==\n\n* [[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 Lead Vocals, Drums, Percussion, Bubbles\n* [[George Harrison]] \u2013 Backing Vocals and Lead Guitar (1961 Fender Stratocaster)\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 Backing Vocals, Bass Guitar (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Tack Piano, Piano\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 Rhythm Guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]])\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Is one of the first 45 songs on [[The Beatles: Rock Band]].\n*Is know as Ringo Starr's most popular song through his career.\n*The song was used in a parody/tribute by College Humor called \"Ringo Wants to Sing More\".\n*Covered by Kermit - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9uo98lORhw Octopus\u00b4s Garden]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/octopus-s-garden/abbey-road Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[ru:Octopus's Garden]]\n[[es:Octopus's Garden]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Ringo Starr]]\n[[Category:Songs on Abbey Road]]"}}}]}}}}
