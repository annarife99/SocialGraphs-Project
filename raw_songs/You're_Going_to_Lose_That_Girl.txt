(album)|album]] and [[Help! (film)|film]] ''Help!'', written by [[John Lennon]] with [[Paul McCartney]]. [[Capitol Records]] originally titled the song \"You're Gonna Lose That Girl\" in the United States.\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe last song recorded before breaking off to make the film, the song was composed at Lennon's house in Weybridge.<ref>http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/youre-going-to-lose-that-girl/ - Beatles Bible</ref> In the lyrics the singer tells his \"friend\" that, if he does not value his girl, the singer will \"make a point of taking her away\" from him. To The Beatles' familiar twist beat and using variations of familiar doo-wop chords, Lennon's nagging lead singing is set in a call-and-response with the enthusiastic answering harmonies of McCartney and [[George Harrison]], offering a last glimpse of the early Beatles' musical home turf.\n\nThe song's bridge has a key change similar to that of the record's previous track \"[[Another Girl]]\", moving up a minor third to G major, the relative major of the tonic minor. In this case the bridge emerges a measure early, diving a semitone down to meet the verse.<ref>http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/ygtltg.shtml - Alan Pollack's Notes</ref>\n\nTo fatten the sound McCartney overdubbed a background piano (a job that once would have been done by producer [[George Martin]] \"live\" on the backing track) and [[Ringo Starr]] added bongos, the addition of Latin-American percussion being another way The Beatles often exploited their new-found access to four-track recording.\n\n==In the film ''Help''==\nIn the film, the group appears singing this song in the recording studio. (In addition to the group's familiar guitar-and-drum setup, there is also footage of Paul McCartney at a piano and Ringo Starr playing the bongos, both miming instruments they had overdubbed onto the recording.)\n\n==Release, pastiche and parody==\nThe song was released in 1965 on the ''Help'' album. In November 1977, Capitol Records scheduled the release of \"[[Girl]]\" backed with \"You're Gonna Lose That Girl\" as a single (Capitol 4506) to accompany the release of ''[[Love Songs]]'', a compilation album which contained both songs. However, the single was cancelled before it was issued.\n\nThe Ramones performed a song titled \"You're Gonna Kill That Girl\" which may have been intended as a parody of the Beatles song.<ref>[http://archive.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2001/04/15/joey/index.html archive.salon.com]</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2014\u00a0Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar ([[Gibson J-160E|1964 Gibson J-160E]])\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2014 Bass Guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1963 Hofner 500/1]]), Piano, Backing Vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2014 Lead Guitar (1961 [[Fender Stratocaster]]), Backing Vocals\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2014 Drums, Bongos\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n\n[[Category:1965 songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon/McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on Help!]]"}}}]}}}}
