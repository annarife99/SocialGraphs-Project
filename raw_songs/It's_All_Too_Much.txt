It was written and sung by [[George Harrison]]. It was originally recorded in 1967, shortly before the release of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', and had been slated to appear on the next EP, ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'', but it was pushed back.\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe song contains several lines taken from other works; the \"With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue\" line was from {{w|The Merseybeats}}' \"{{w|Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow}}\", and the trumpets at many points emulate {{w|Jeremiah Clarke}}'s \"{{w|Prince of Denmark's March}}\".\n\n==Recording==\nThe song was recorded at De Lane Lea Studios, making it one of only a very few Beatles tracks not recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Harrison played organ, Lennon played bass, while McCartney played lead guitar on the song. Other than their earlier hit \"[[I Feel Fine]]\", this was the only other Beatles track to use feedback extensively. The track had the working title of \"Too Much\".\n\nThe shout by [[John Lennon]] during the intro was \u201cto Jorma!\u201d, referring to {{w|Jorma Kaukonen}}, the former {{w|Jefferson Airplane}}/{{w|Hot Tuna}} lead guitarist and early experimenter in feedback.\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[George Harrison]] - lead vocals, lead guitar ([[Fender Stratocaster|1961 Fender Stratocaster]]), Organ (Hammond RT-3)\n* [[John Lennon]] - harmony vocals, lead guitar ([[Epiphone 230TD Casino|1965 Epiphone ES-230TD Casino]])\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - harmony vocals, bass ([[Rickenbacker 4001S|1964 Rickenbacker 4001S]]), cowbell\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - drums (1964 Ludwig Super Classic Black Oyster Pearl), tambourine\n* {{w|David Mason (trumpeter)|David Mason}} and three others - trumpets\n* [[Paul Harvey]] - bass clarinet\n:Personnel per The Beatles Bible<ref name=\"BeatlesBible\">{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/its-all-too-much/|title=The Beatles Bible: It's All Too Much|accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>\n\n==Different Versions==\n\nA mono mix, over eight minutes long and containing all of the lyrics plus a much longer ending than the eventual released versions, has never been released officially, but has been found on bootleg recordings.\n\nThe best-known version of the song was further edited down to over six minutes long and appears on the ''Yellow Submarine'' soundtrack album. The version of the song that appeared in the film itself is slightly different and contained a lyric that was cut from the album version:\n\n\"Nice to have the time to take this opportunity/Time for me to look at you and you to look at me.\" However, this lyric remains in the eight-minute mono mix. Just before this lyric is another refrain not used in either the movie or the soundtrack albums: \"It's all too much for me to take/There's plenty more for everybody/The more you give, the more you get/The more it is and it's too much.\"\n\n==Cover versions==\n\n\"It's All Too Much\" has been covered by the {{w|Grateful Dead}} (live), {{w|Ratdog}} (live), {{w|The Church (band)|The Church}}, {{w|All About Eve (band)|All About Eve}}, {{w|Steve Hillage}}, {{w|Paul Gilbert}}, {{w|The Violet Burning}}, {{w|Yukihiro Takahashi}}, {{w|The House of Love}}, {{w|Rich Robinson (Black Crowes)|Rich Robinson}}, and in a heavily rewritten version by {{w|Journey (band)|Journey}}.\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/it-s-all-too-much/yellow-submarine Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:Songs written by George Harrison]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]"}}}]}}}}
