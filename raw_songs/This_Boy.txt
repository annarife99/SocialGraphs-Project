The song was recorded with a rounded ending; however, it was faded out during a mixing session on October 21.\n\nTwo alternate recordings have also been officially released. A live version performed on ''The Morecambe and Wise Show'' in 1963 was released on ''[[Anthology 1]]'', and two incomplete takes from the original recording were released as a track on the single \"[[Free as a Bird]]\".\n[[File:Thisboysingle.jpg|thumb|This Boy Single\n]]\n\n==Credits==\n\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 acoustic guitar ([[Gibson J-160E|1962 Gibson J-160E]]), lead vocal\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 bass guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1963 Hofner 500/1]]), harmony vocal\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead guitar ([[Gibson J-160E|1962 Gibson J-160E]]), harmony vocal\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 brushed hi-hat, brushed snare\n\n==Lyrics==\nThat boy took my love away\nThough he'll regret it someday\nBut this boy wants you back again\n\nThat boy isn't good for you\nThough he may want you too\nThis boy wants you back again\n\nOh, and this boy would be happy\nJust to love you, but oh my\nThat boy won't be happy\nTill he's seen you cry\n\nThis boy wouldn't mind the pain\nWould always feel the same\nIf this boy gets you back again\n\nThis boy\nThis boy\nThis boy [fade out]\n[[Category:The Beatles singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Non-album singles]]\n[[Category:B-sides]]"}}}]}}}}
