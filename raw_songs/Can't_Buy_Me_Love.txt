It was released as a single with \"[[You Can't Do That]]\" as it's B-side. The song is featured on the album ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]].''\n\n== About ==\n\nWhile the Beatles were in Paris they stayed at the five star George V hotel and a grand piano was moved into one of their suites so that songwriting could continue. It was here that McCartney came up with \"Can't Buy Me Love.\"\n\nRecorded the same day as the German songs (\"[[Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand]]\" and \"[[Sie Liebt Dich]]\"), \"Can't Buy Me Love\" was captured in just four takes. As can be heard on the [[Anthology]], the song was originally more bluesy with John and George adding similar backing vocals. Take three was the first to feature the more familiar sound, beginning with the chorus rather than a verse, which was [[George Martin]]'s idea.\n\nTake four, the master, features a overdubbed lead vocal and lead guitar solo which were recorded back at EMI on February 25. The guitar solo is different on the mono and stereo versions, with the overdub being much sloppier on the latter version.\n\nThis single hit #1 on both sides of the Atlantic. In fact, when it was #1 in America on April 4, 1964, it was followed by \"[[Twist and Shout]],\" \"[[She Loves You]],\" \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\" and \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]],\" a feat which no other artiste has come even close to matching.\n\n\"Can't Buy Me Love\" was featured not once, but twice in ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. The first being the band's exuberant escape from the television studio to have a run in the field and the second during their run from and after the police trying to find Ringo for the big show.\n\n''Rolling Stone'' ranked \"Can't Buy Me Love\" at #289 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n==Credits==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 bass guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1963 Hofner 500/1]]), lead vocals\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 rhythm guitar ([[Gibson J-160E|1964 Gibson J-160E]])\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead guitar ([[Grestch Tennessean|1963 Gretsch Tennessean]])\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 drums\n*[[Norman Smith]] - hi-hat (stereo only)\n[[Category:The Beatles singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs in C major]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on A Hard Day's Night]]"}}}]}}}}
