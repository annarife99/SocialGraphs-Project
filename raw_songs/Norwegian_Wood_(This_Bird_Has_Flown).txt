This track is generally credited as being the first pop recording to use the sitar, an Indian stringed instrument (although [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/OlderThanTheyThink/Music as the TV Tropes Wiki points out], this is wrong; the first known pop recording featuring a sitar was \"Goodness Gracious Me\" in 1960, and the Kinks also got there before the Beatles). \"Norwegian Wood\" sparked a musical craze for the sound of the novel instrument in the mid-Sixties. The song is now acknowledged as one of the cornerstones of what is now usually called \"world music\", and it was a major landmark in the trend towards incorporating non-Western musical influences into Western popular music. Harrison was recently introduced to Indian classical music and the sitar by David Crosby of the Byrds. He soon became fanatically interested in the genre and began taking sitar lessons from renowned Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar.\n\nNorwegian Wood was John Lennon's way of telling his wife (Cynthia Lennon) that he had an affair.\n\nThe song was recorded 12 and 21 October 1965 in EMI Studios. Early version (Take 1) was published in the [[Anthology 2]], and Take 2 in an informal bootleg.\n\n{{TMCP Song|norwegian-wood-the-bird-has-flown}}\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse 1]\n\nI once had a girl\n\nOr should I say, she once had me?\n\nShe showed me her room\n\nIsn't it good?\n\nNorwegian Wood\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nShe asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere\n\nSo I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nI sat on the rug\n\nBiding my time, drinking her wine\n\nWe talked until two\n\nAnd then she said, \"it's time for bed\"\n\n\n[Bridge 2]\n\nShe told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh\n\nI told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nAnd when I awoke\n\nI was alone, this bird has flown\n\nSo I lit a fire \n\nIsn't it good?\n\nNorwegian Wood\n<br />\n==Credits==\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2014 lead vocals, 6-string acoustic guitar ([[Gibson J-160E|1962 Gibson J-160E]])\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2014 harmony vocals, bass guitar ([[Rickenbacker 4001S|1964 Rickenbacker 4001S]]) or (1963 [[Hofner 500/1|H\u00f6fner 500/1]])\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2014 sitar, 12-string acoustic guitar ([[List of Instruments#Framus|1964 Framus Hootenanny 5/024]])\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2014 tambourine, bass drum, finger cymbals\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* The plot the song is about a man who becomes in love with a woman and meets her at her house. They talk, she gets the man's hopes up and then ruins them by going to bed (alone and without him), and playing at being ignorant of how she led the man on, she goes to bed without him and he goes to sleep in the bathtub. And then, when he awakens, he realizes he's alone and then lights a fire, burning down the house, probably killing his former-lover asking, \"isn't it good?\"\n\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Rubber Soul]]"}}}]}}}}
