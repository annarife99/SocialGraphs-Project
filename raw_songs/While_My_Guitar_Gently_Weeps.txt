It was included on [[The Beatles (album)|''The Beatles'']] album, also known as ''The White Album''. This song has appeared on Rolling Stone's Top 500 Songs List at #135, and #7 on Rolling Stone's Top 100 Greatest Guitar Songs.{{Fact}}\n\n==Creation==\nHarrison has said that the inspiration for this song came from reading I Ching, and this inspired him to do a song about how everything is relative. The way he chose the name was by opening a random book, and seeing that the first words were \"Gently Weeps,\" so he decided to give that to the song.{{Fact}}\n\nThe song was originally to be performed on acoustic guitar, as shown on a demo made at George's house in Esher, in May 1968. When he initially took the song into the studio, the song was also done on acoustic, with a light harmonium backing (''Anthology 3''). Stung by his bandmates' apathy to the song, he decided to \"re-make\" the song, in a very heavy fashion.\n\nHarrison invited close friend Eric Clapton to play the lead guitar on the track, as he thought this would make the other Beatles act sweetly, as one always does when company calls.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse 1]\n\nI look at you all\n\nSee the love there that's sleeping\n\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\n\nI look at the floor\n\nAnd I see it needs sweeping\n\nStill my guitar gently weeps\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nI don't know why-y-y\n\nNobody told you\n\nHow to unfold your love\n\nI don't know how-ow-ow\n\nSomeone controlled you\n\nThey bought and sold you\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nI look at the world\n\nAnd I notice it's turning\n\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\n\nWith every mistake\n\nWe must surely be learning\n\nStill my guitar gently weeps\n\n\n[Verse 4]\n\nI don't know how-ow-ow\n\nYou were diverted\n\nYou were perverted too\n\nI don't know how-ow-ow\n\nYou were inverted\n\nNo one alerted you\n\n\n[Verse 5]\n\nI look at you all\n\nSee the love there that's sleeping\n\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\n\n(I look) Look at you all\n\nStill my guitar gently weeps\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nOh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh oh\n<br />\n==Reaction from other Beatles==\nThe reaction from the other [[Beatles]] was less than enthusiastic.
