It appeared on the [[Rubber Soul]]&nbsp;album and one of the few Beatles songs that includes French lyrics. Uniquely, Paul, John and George all played acoustic guitars with capos on the 5th fret (the photo from the session shows Paul on his 6-string Epiphone Texan, John on his nylon-string acoustic guitar and George on John's Framus Hootenanny 12-string) while George played his solos on his Gibson J-160E in unison with George Martin on a Hohner Pianet out of microphone range and Paul even applied a capo to the 5th fret of his Rickenbacker bass when overdubbing his bass part.\n\n==Recording==\n'''November 3, 1965''', 2:30-11:30 pm-The afternoon was spent filling four tracks with the rhythm track. Then, this was mixed down onto three tracks so they could fill the fourth track with overdubbed vocals and guitar. Occasional EMI tape operator Jerry Boys, on listening to playback of the song as they were working on it that night, said: \"I stood there quite spellbound. It sounded lovely. George [Martin] asked me what I thought of the Beatles singing a song with French lyrics and I got the impression that with me being a young chap he was sounding me out, perhaps because they weren't too sure themselves. I said it sounded very pleasant, which it certainly did!\"*\n\n'''November 9, 1965'''- Mono mixing (unused) and stereo mixing.\n\n'''November 15, 1965'''- Mono mixing.\n\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>''The Beatles Reocrding Sessions''\n==Translation==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 500px\"\n|+Translation (French to English)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center\"|FRENCH\n| style=\"text-align: center\"|ENGLISH\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center\"|\"Michelle, Ma Belle.\"\n|\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\"Michelle, My Beautiful.\"</p>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center\"|\"Sont des mots qui vont tr\u00e8s bien ensemble.\"\n| style=\"text-align: center\"|\"These are words that go together well.\"\n|}\n\n==Credits==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] - Lead Vocals, 6-String Acoustic Guitar ([[Epiphone Texan]]), Bass ([[Rickenbacker 4001S]])\n*[[John Lennon]] - Nylon-String Acoustic Guitar (Jose Ramirez), Backing Vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] - 12-String Acoustic Guitar (Framus Hootenanny), Lead Guitar Solos (1963 Gretsch Tenessean), Backing Vocals\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - Drums\n\n==Links==\n* [http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Beatles:Michelle Lyrics at LyricWiki]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Rubber Soul]]"}}}]}}}}
