Naked]] in 2003. \"Dig a Pony\" was the second to last song played on the concert on the rooftop of Apple Studios in Savile Row, London on January 30, 1969.\n\n==Composition==\n[[John Lennon]] was the song's composer and singer but the song was credited to Lennon/McCartney. Lennon would later comment that he thought the song was \"a piece of garbage,\" though he has shown similar scorn for many of his songs. It was written for his soon-to-be wife [[Yoko Ono]], and featured a multitude of strange, seemingly nonsense phrases which were strung together, culminating in the chorus \"All I want is you\", aimed at Yoko.\n\n==Credits==\n* [[John Lennon]] - lead vocals, lead guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]])\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - bass (1963 [[Hofner 500/1]]), backing vocals\n* [[George Harrison]] - rhythm guitar (1968 [[Fender Telecaster]]), backing vocals\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - drums\n* [[Billy Preston]] - piano (1965 [[Fender Rhodes]])\n\n==Cover Versions==\nThe American funk rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers covered this song as an introduction to \"I Could Die For You\" while touring to support their 2002 album \"By the Way.\" Yellow Matter Custard also covered the song in their 2003 tour. St. Vincent covered this song for a Black Cab Session in October 2007, as well as several times throughout her 2007 tour. It has also been covered by Laibach on their album \"Let It Be,\" which is a complete re-working of the Beatles album \"Let It Be.\" Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio frequently covered the song on his 2005 tour with his band, 70 Volt Parade.
