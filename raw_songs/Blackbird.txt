It was included on the compilation album [[Love (album)|''Love'']]. It originally appeared on 1968 Beatles album [http://beatles.wikia.com/wiki/The_Beatles_(album) The White Album]. The Love version of this song is only the guitar part, with no words, and flows into the song Yesterday, also by Paul McCartney. On The White Album, the song came between two other songs with animal names: [[Piggies]] and [[Rocky Raccoon]] (although the latter is about a man nicknamed that, not a literal raccoon). Blackbird is the only song by The Beatles that has only one instrument part, other than a tapping foot and bird song sounds.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse 1]\n\nBlackbird singing in the dead of night\n\nTake these broken wings and learn to fly\n\nAll your life\n\nYou were only waiting for this moment to arise\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nBlackbird singing in the dead of night\n\nTake these sunken eyes and learn to see\n\nAll your life\n\nYou were only waiting for this moment to be free\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nBlackbird fly, blackbird fly\n\nInto the light of the dark black night\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nBlackbird fly, blackbird fly\n\nInto the light of the dark black night\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nBlackbird singing in the dead of night\n\nTake these broken wings and learn to fly\n\nAll your life\n\nYou were only waiting for this moment to arise\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nYou were only waiting for this moment to arise\n\nYou were only waiting for this moment to arise\n\n==Credits==\n*Paul McCartney - Lead Vocals, Acoustic Guitar (1967 [[Martin D-28]]), Tape Loops and Foot-taps\n\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on The White Album]]"}}}]}}}}
