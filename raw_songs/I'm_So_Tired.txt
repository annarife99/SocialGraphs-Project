Lennon wrote the song at a Transcendental Meditation camp when he couldn't sleep. The Beatles had gone on a retreat to study with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in Rishikesh, India. After three weeks of constant meditation and lectures, Lennon's mind was turning to cigarettes and a drink, it was also turning to Yoko whom he had not started an affair with yet. He had entertained the idea of bringing Yoko to India but realized how complicated it would have been having his then-wife Cynthia and Yoko under the same roof.\n\n== Recording ==\nThe song was recorded at Abbey Road on 8 October 1968 and was completed including all overdubs in this one session. The Beatles also started and completed the Lennon-composed \"[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]\" during the same recording session.\n\n== Personnel ==\n* John Lennon - Lead Vocals, Acoustic Guitar (1962 Gibson J-160E), Rhythm Guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]]), Organ (Hammond RT-3)\n* Paul McCartney - Bass (1966 [[Fender Jazz Bass]]) or (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Electric Piano (Hohner Pianet C), harmony vocals\n* George Harrison - Lead Guitar (1961 [[Fender Stratocaster|Fender Sonic Blue Stratocaster]])\n* Ringo Starr - Drums (1968 [[Ludwig Hollywood Maple]] )\n\n== Relation to the \"Paul is dead\" hoax ==\nAt the end of this song, mumbling can be heard that sounds like \"Ssim mih, ssim mihm, ssim mih. Nam ded see lope.\" When played backward, some claim a scared voice intones, \"Paul is dead, man, miss him, miss him, MISS HIM!\" although there have been other claims that on different versions of this song, Lennon can be heard mumbling the words \"Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?\"  The mumbling may be Lennon's attempt at speaking in reverse, without physically reversing the sound.\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/i-m-so-tired/the-beatles Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on The White Album]]"}}}]}}}}
