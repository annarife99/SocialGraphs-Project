Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]. It is sung by a young man to his lover, and is about his plans of growing old together with her. Although the theme is about aging, it was one of the first songs McCartney wrote, when he was sixteen. The Beatles used it in the early days as a song they could play when the amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off. Both George Martin and Mark Lewisohn speculated that McCartney may have thought of the song when recording began for Sgt. Pepper in December 1966 because his father turned 64 earlier that year.\n\nLennon said of the song, \"Paul wrote it in the [[Cavern Club|Cavern]] days. We just stuck a few more words on it like 'grandchildren on your knee' and 'Vera, Chuck and Dave' ... this was just one that was quite a hit with us.\" In his 1980 interview for Playboy he said, \"I would never even dream of writing a song like that.\"\n\nThe song was nearly released on a single as the B-side with either \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" or \"[[Penny Lane]]\" as the A-side. Instead, Martin decided on a double-A-sided-disc. The single did not make #1 in the UK, breaking a string of #1 singles going back to 1963. If \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" had been issued as a B-side, it would not have appeared on Sgt. Pepper.\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, the song was \"aimed chiefly at parents, and as a result got a cool reception from the [Beatles'] own generation.\"\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse 1]\n\nWhen I get older losing my hair\n\nMany years from now\n\nWill you still be sending me a valentine\n\nBirthday greetings, bottle of wine?\n\nIf I'd been out till quarter to three\n\nWould you lock the door?\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWill you still need me, will you still feed me\n\nWhen I'm sixty four?\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nYou'll be older too\n\nAnd if you say the word\n\nI could stay with you\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nI could be handy, mending a fuse\n\nWhen your lights have gone\n\nYou can knit a sweater by the fireside\n\nSunday mornings go for a ride\n\nDoing the garden, digging the weeds\n\nWho could ask for more?\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWill you still need me, will you still feed me\n\nWhen I'm sixty four?\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nEvery summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight\n\nIf it's not too dear\n\nWe shall scrimp and save\n\nGrandchildren on your knee\n\nVera, Chuck and Dave\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nSend me a postcard, drop me a line\n\nStating point of view\n\nIndicate precisely what you mean to say\n\nYours sincerely, wasting away\n\nGive me your answer, fill in a form\n\nMine forevermore\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWill you still need me, will you still feed me\n\nWhen I'm sixty four?\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nHo!\n\n==Credits==\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Vocal, Backing Vocal, Bass ([[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Piano (Hamburg Steinway Baby Grand)\n* [[John Lennon]] - Backing Vocal, Guitar ([[Epiphone 230TD Casino]])\n* [[George Harrison|George Harrison  -]]  Backing Vocal\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - Drums (Ludwig Super Classic Black Oyster Pearl), Tubular Bells\n* Robert Burns, Henry MacKenzie - Clarinet\n* Frank Reidy - Bass Clarinet\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Sgt.
