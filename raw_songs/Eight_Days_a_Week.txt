The song was released on the album ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'' and released as a single in 1965. It was one of the 1964 or 65 hits.\n[[File:Eightdaysaweeksingle.jpg|thumb|Eight Days A Week Single]]\n== About ==\n\nThe title for the song was taken from a conversaton between Paul and his chauffeur,  Paul walked straight into John's house and said \"I got the title, 'Eight Days a Week'.\"\n\nOn October 6, 1964, the Beatles began sessions for \"Eight Days a Week.\" Take one was a straight, no frills attempt on acoustic guitars. On take two, John and Paul used a succession of harmonized \"Oohs\" climbing up the scale for the intro. On take three, they combined their harmony with the acoustic guitars. On take four, the \"Oohs\" remained at the same pitch throughout. Take five incorporated the \"Oohs\" at the end as well as the beginning. Take six was the first to resemble the finished version, upon this, John double tracked a lead vocal. The final overdub, take 13, was marked the best take - that is until October 18 when the group taped edit pieces (takes 14 & 15) for the intro and outro, although the intro piece was never used. In mixing, the song was also faded in, instead of out - a first in recorded pop history.\n\nThe Beatles, especially John, never cared for \"Eight Days a Week\" and never performed it live.\n\nThe song was issued as a single in the United States on February 15, 1965 after DJs began playing the song frequently after they had obtained imported copies of the British ''Beatles For Sale'' album which had been released in the UK the previous December.\n\n\"Eight Days a Week\" has been covered by many artists, including [[Billy Preston]] and Joan Jett.\n\n==Credits==\n* [[John Lennon]] - lead vocals, rhythm guitar ([[Gibson J-160E|1964 Gibson J-160E]]), handclaps\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - bass ([[Hofner 500/1|1963 Hofner 500/1]]), backing vocals, handclaps\n* [[George Harrison]] - lead guitar ([[Grestch Country Gentleman|1963 Gretsch 6122 Country Gentleman]], [[Rickenbacker 360/12|1963 Rickenbacker 360/12]]), handclaps\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - drums\n[[Category:The Beatles singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Beatles for Sale]]"}}}]}}}}
