[[John Lennon]] and [[Ringo Starr]] were working on other ''White Album'' songs, and [[George Harrison]] was on holiday in Greece.\n\nMcCartney said of this song: \"We were in an experimental mode, and so I said, 'Can I just make something up?' I started off with the guitar and did a multitracking experiment in the control room or maybe in the little room next door. It was very home-made; it wasn't a big production at all. I just made up this short piece and I multitracked a harmony to that, and a harmony to that, and a harmony to that, and built it up sculpturally with a lot of vibrato on the [guitar] strings, really pulling the strings madly. Hence, 'Wild Honey Pie', which was a reference to the other song I had written called '[[Honey Pie]]'.\"\n\nAccording to McCartney, the song might have been excluded from ''The Beatles'' album, but George's then-wife [[Pattie Boyd]] \"liked it very much so we decided to leave it on the album.\"\ufeff\n\n<br />\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Chorus]\n\nHoney pie\n\nHoney pie\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHoney pie\n\nHoney pie\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHoney pie\n\nHoney pie\n\nHoney pie\n\nHoney pie\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nI love you, honey pie\n<br />\n==Credits==\n*Paul McCartney - vocals, acoustic guitar (1967 [[Martin D-28]]), drums\nThe song has been covered by:\n*Pixies in 1988, included on their 1998 album ''Pixies at the BBC''.\n*Part Chimp - they recorded the song in 2005 for BBC Radio 1's anniversary of [[John Lennon]]'s death.\n==Music blog==\nWild Honey Pie is the namesake for the New York-based indie music blog, The Wild Honey Pie.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/wild-honey-pie/the-beatles Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on The White Album]]\n[[Category:1968 songs]]"}}}]}}}}
