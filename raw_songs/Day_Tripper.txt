It was released in 1965 as part of the double A-sided single with [[We Can Work It Out]].\n\nThe composition is believed by some to have been inspired by marijuana, not least due to the word \"tripper\" in the title. However, \"day tripper\" is a common term in British English for someone who goes on a one-day coach outing (as seen in ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''), and this is probably yet another Beatles \"drug reference\" which in fact is just a coincidence. John Lennon has said that he really meant \"weekend hippie.\"\n\nThe song was recorded on October 16, 1965, during sessions for the ''Rubber Soul'' album. The song was recorded in three takes. Take three was used on the final record.
