The song was written by Paul McCartney<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-0\">[1]</sup> and credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]]. It was released in 1964 on the ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'' album in the United Kingdom and on ''[[Beatles '65]]'' in the United States, but was written long before that year: a version recorded in 1960 can be found in the bootleg record ''You Might As Well Call Us The Quarrymen''. The song is somewhat of a cult favourite; it was released as a mono extended 45 in 1964 on Parlophone/EMI (and in 1995 as a B-side).\n==Lyrics==\nThe song's lyrics centre around a man who feels he is unappreciated by a woman. The song is believed to be him giving her an ultimatum, and that, as the lyrics state, \"One day, you'll look to see I've gone.\" There is an unwillingness on the part of the song's narrator that adds a tenderness and tragedy to his leaving: \"And now the time has come, and so, my love, I must go. And though I lose a friend, in the end you will know...\"\ufeff\n\n==Credits==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 bass guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1963 Hofner 500/1]]), lead vocals\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 rhythm guitar ([[Gibson J-160E|1964 Gibson J-160E]]), harmony vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead guitar (1962 [[Gibson J-160E]], [[Grestch Tennessean|1963 Gretsch Tennessean]])\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 percussion\n\n==Cover versions==\n*The song was covered by David Ball in 1995 for the Beatles tribute album ''Come Together: America Salutes The Beatles''.\n*McCartney performed the song live at the Paris Olympia, 2007 and at {{w|Tel Aviv}}, {{w|Israel}}, on 25 September 2008 and in {{w|Quebec City}} for the free outdoor concert on 20 July 2008.
