It was the B-side to the [[Ticket to Ride]] single. However, John hated this song, calling it \"an attempt to rewrite [[This Boy]], that didn't work\". Paul McCartney on the other hand said: \"It's a very fine song of John's.\" An alternate version is on \"[[Anthology 2]],\" features John by himself singing by himself on Take 2. The song was recorded start to finish in under five hours.\n\n== Release and Reception ==\n\"Yes It Is\" was released as the B-side of the \"Ticket to Ride\" single in both the US and the UK. American pressings of the single erroneously show \"Yes It Is\" as being from the film Eight Arms to Hold You (the original title for the film, Help!), in which it did not appear. It reached number 46 in the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nYes It Is was released with adequate to great reviews, liking the bridge section and the nice rewrote lyrics, but disliking the fact that it is incredibly slow and too long. \n\n==Credits==\n* [[John Lennon]] - Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar (Jose Ramirez)\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Bass Guitar ([[Hofner 500/1]]), Harmony Vocal\n* [[George Harrison]] - Lead Guitar ([[Grestch Tennessean]]), Harmony Vocal\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - Drums\n\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:B-sides]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Non-album singles]]"}}}]}}}}
