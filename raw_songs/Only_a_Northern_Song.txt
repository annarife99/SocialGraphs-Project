It was originally intended for the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album but would eventually wind up on the ''[[Yellow Submarine (album)|Yellow Submarine]]'' album.\n\nHarrison reportedly wrote this song to express his disgust at the publishing situation of the Beatles' his songs were published by [[Northern Songs]], and [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] thus got most of the royalties from them. It was partly to rectify this that Harrison eventually founded his own publishing company, [[Harrisongs]].\n\nin the DVD issue of the ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' movie, the subtitles of this song erroneously rendered the chorus as \"only a normal song\" instead of the title. The Blu-Ray release sidestepped this problem by not subtitling lyrics.\n\n==Credits==\n* [[George Harrison]] - Lead Vocals, Organ (Hammond L100), Sound effects, Voices\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Bass guitar ([[Rickenbacker 4001S|1964 Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Trumpet,\n* [[John Lennon]] - Piano (1905 Steinway Vertegrand), Glockenspiel\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - Drums\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/only-a-northern-song/yellow-submarine Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n{{song stub}}\n[[Category:Songs written by George Harrison]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Yellow Submarine]]"}}}]}}}}
