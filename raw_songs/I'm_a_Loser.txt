Written by John Lennon.\n\nOn the original pressings of ''Beatles for Sale'', the song was misprinted as \"I'm a Loseer\".\n\n==Composition==\n\nThe song's refrain sings, \"I'm a loser, and I've lost someone who's near to me. I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be.\" The lyrics appear to be about a man who lost a woman; however Lennon later suggested that he constantly felt like a loser in life.  Lennon would later compose self-oriented songs without using love as a metaphor.\n\nLennon hits a low G in the verses, a note usually reserved for bass singers.  This is atypical of Lennon, considering he sang the bulk of his Beatles songs in a higher, tenor register.  However, he also sang a low G in \"[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]\" and the backing vocals of \"[[Love Me Do]]\".\n\nSinger [[Jackie DeShannon]] was on The Beatles' summer 1964 North American tour. She recalled that Lennon was writing this song on the plane during the tour. According to music critic [[Richie Unterberger]], \"Musically, 'I'm a Loser' is also notable for being perhaps the first Beatles song to directly reflect the influence of [[Bob Dylan]], thus nudging folk and rock a little closer together toward the folk-rock explosion of the following year.\"\n\n==Recording and release==\n\nThe Beatles recorded this song on 14 August 1964, the same day as \"[[Mr. Moonlight]]\" and \"[[Leave My Kitten Alone]]\". It was recorded in eight takes with no overdubs.\n\nIt was released four months after it was recorded, but beforehand, it was previewed on BBC Radio on 17 August, along with three other songs from ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'' and also the \"[[I Feel Fine]]\"/\"[[She's a Woman]]\" single.\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 12-string acoustic guitar (Framus Hootenanny), harmonica, lead vocals\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 bass guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1963 Hofner 500/1]]), harmony vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead guitar ([[Grestch Tennessean|1963 Gretsch 6119 Tennessean]])\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 drums, tambourine\n:Personnel per [[Ian MacDonald]]\n\n==Covers==\n\nThis song was covered by the [[Lost Dogs]] on their 1993 album, ''[[Little Red Riding Hood (album)|Little Red Riding Hood]]''. In 2004 [[The Punkles]] did a cover of this song on their third album ''Pistol''. The bands Sum 41 and [[Eels (band)|Eels]] have also covered it live in concert, the latter releasing it on ''[[Sixteen Tons (Ten Songs)]]''. [[Doug Kershaw]] covered the song on his 1977 album ''Flip, Flop, and Fly.''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web\n  |work=The Beatles Bible\n  |year=2009\n  |title=I'm a Loser\n  |url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/im-a-loser/\n  |accessdate=2009-04-14\n  |ref={{SfnRef|The Beatles Bible|2009}}}}\n* {{cite book\n  |last=MacDonald\n  |first=Ian\n  |year=2005\n  |authorlink=Ian MacDonald\n  |title=Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties\n  |publisher=Pimlico (Rand)\n  |edition=Second Revised\n  |location=London\n  |isbn=1-844-13828-3\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web\n  |last=Unterberger\n  |first=Richie\n  |year=2009\n  |authorlink=Richie Unterberger\n  |title=Review of \"I'm a Loser\"\n  |publisher=[[AllMusic]]\n  |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:wvfexqqkldke\n  |accessdate=2009-09-25\n  |ref=harv}}\n\n[[ru:I'm a Loser]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Beatles for Sale]]"}}}]}}}}
