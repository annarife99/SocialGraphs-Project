In fact, the song was designed to reflect Indian music, so he had almost no help from the other Beatles, using professional Indian player. It is a love song to Pattie Boyd, with the song having themes from experimenting with the drug\u00a0[[LSD]]. The song is claimed for introducing non-Western themes, and for incorporating Indian music.\n==Recording==\nLove You To was placed on the third track in Revolver. The song was first recorded with Harrison on vocals and acoustic guitar, with Paul McCartney and John Lennon on backing vocals. There were three takes of this version\u00a0\u2013 Harrison implemented sitar later in these first takes. At 8 pm, musicians from the Asian Music Circle, situated in London, were then recorded. Various takes with the Asian Music Circle were recorded. Take six was then chosen as best and a reduction mix on the song started. \"Take 7\" had more of Harrison's vocals, and Ringo Star playing tambourine. Harrison also placed a fuzz-tone electric guitar in the mix.<ref name =\"Beatles Bible\">http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/love-you-to/</ref>\nFinal mixing commenced on June 21.
