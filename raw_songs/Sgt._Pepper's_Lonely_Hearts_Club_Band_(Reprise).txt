Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)''' is a repeat of [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] at a faster tempo with heavier instrumentation. While the opening track stays largely in the key of G major (except for transient modulation to F and perhaps C in the bridges), the reprise starts in F and modulates back to G. The track opens with a distorted guitar strumming a \"Hendrix chord\" (dominant 7th sharp 9). [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]] counts 1..2..3..4, and between 2 and 3, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] jokingly adds, \"Bye!\".\n\nThe idea for a reprise was [[Neil Aspinall|Aspinall's]] , who thought that as there was a \"welcome song\", there should be a \"goodbye song\". The song contains the same melody as the opening version, but with different lyrics. At 1:18, it is one of [[The Beatles]] ' shorter songs (the shortest is \"[[Her Majesty]]\" at 0:23). The reprise was recorded on 1 April 1967, two months after the version that opens the album. At the end of the track, [[George Martin|Martin's]] pre-recorded applause sample segues into the final track of the album, \"[[A Day in the Life]]\".\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Intro]\n\n(One, two, three, four)\n\n(Bye!)\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nWe're Sgt.
