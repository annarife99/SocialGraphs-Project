Lennon asked George Martin to play a piano solo. Martin arranged a Bach-influenced piece, which he was not able to play at the song's tempo. The solo was recorded on October 22, 1965 at half-tempo (one octave lower), and the tape speed was doubled for the final recording, with the fortuitous result that it sounded like a harpsichord.\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2014 Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar (1961 [[Fender Stratocaster]])\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2014 Bass (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Harmony Vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2014 Lead Guitar (1961 [[Fender Stratocaster]]), Harmony Vocals\n*[[Ringo Starr]] _ Drums (Ludwig Super Classic Black Oyster Pearl), Tambourine\n*[[George Martin]] \u2014 Piano (1964 Steinway Hamburg Baby Grand) (With Half-Speed)\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Rubber Soul]]\n[[Category:1965 songs]]"}}}]}}}}
