McCartney said: \"I had no idea until much later that it was from ''The Music Man''.\" \"Till There Was You\" was part of the Beatles' repertoire in 1962 and performed at the Star Club in Hamburg. It became illustrative of the Beatles' versatility, proving they could appeal to all sections of an audience, moving easily from softer ballads to harder rock and roll, as their appearance on November 4, 1963 at the Royal Variety Performance when they followed this song with \"[[Twist and Shout]]\".\n\nThe band had previously performed \"Till There Was You\" as part of their failed audition for Decca Records in London on New Years Day of 1962, and it was the second of five the group sang during their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964.\n\nLive versions of the song were released on ''[[Live at the BBC]]'' (1994) and ''[[Anthology 1]]'' (1995). The latter version was recorded when the Beatles played at the Royal Variety Performance; because the album was cut so that live numbers began with the actual song, John Lennon's famous request that those in the royal box \"rattle your jewellery\" to \"Twist and Shout\" is in fact included on the \"Till There Was You\" track. When introducing this song (likewise placed on \"She Loves You\" for Anthology), McCartney commented that the song had also been recorded by our favourite American group, Sophie Tucker\". This tongue-in-cheek comment by McCartney unwittingly began an urban legend that \"Till There Was You\" was an old Sophie Tucker song, when in fact, there is no record of her ever performing the tune.\n\n==Linguistic Note==\nThe official title is as given here, but it should actually have been called '''{{'}}Til There Was You''' (\"until\"); \"till\" means \"a cash register\" or \"to plough\".\n\n==Credits==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 lead vocals, bass guitar (1961 [[Hofner 500/1]])\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 acoustic rhythm guitar (1962 [[Gibson J-160E]])\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead acoustic guitar (1950 Jose Ramirez DeEstudio)\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 bongos\n\n==Credits==\n[[wikipedia:Meredith Willson|Meredith Willson]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on With the Beatles]]\n[[Category:Cover Songs]]\n[[Category:Meet The Beatles]]"}}}]}}}}
