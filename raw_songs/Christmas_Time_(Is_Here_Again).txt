It was later included, along with the group's other annual fan club Christmas records, in the [[1970]] compilation LP [[The Beatles' Christmas Album]] (which was also made available exclusively to fan club members).\n\nThe song was officially released in [[1995]] on the ''[[Free as a Bird]]'' single, for which it was edited from its original 6:17 to a shortened version of 3:03. The song opens with a light-hearted tune from all four of the Beatles and occasionally cuts to a tale of the Beatles arriving at the fictional BBC house. This part of the song was cut from the 1995 single version. The song then closes with a Christmas greeting from all four of the Beatles. At the end, Auld Lang Syne is played on the organ as [[John Lennon]] reads one of his original nonsense freeverse poems.\n==Christmas Greetings From The Beatles==\nPaul: This is Paul McCartney here, I'd just like to wish you all you wish yourselves for Christmas.\n\nJohn: This is John Lennon, saying on behalf of The Beatles, saying have a very happy Christmas and a good new year.\n\nGeorge: George Harrison speaking, I'd like to take this oppurtunity of wishing a very merry Christmas to listeners everywhere.\n\nRingo: This is Ringo Starr and I'd just like to say merry Christmas and a really happy new year to all listeners.\n==Credits==\n[[John Lennon]] \u2013 vocals, bass drum<br />\n[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 vocals, piano<br />\n[[George Harrison]] \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar<br />\n[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 vocals, drums, tap dancing<br />\n[[George Martin]] \u2013 vocals<br />\n[[Victor Spinetti]] \u2013 vocals, tap dancing<br />\n[[Mal Evans]] \u2013 spoken word<br />\n\n\n{{stub}}\n[[Category:B-sides]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]"}}}]}}}}
