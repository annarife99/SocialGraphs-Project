Years later, McCartney described it as a \"formula song\",<ref name=\"miles1p163\">{{cite book |first=Barry |last=Miles |authorlink=Barry Miles |title=Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now |year=1997 |publisher=Henry Holt & Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-5249-6 |page=163}}</ref> and Lennon said, \"I would never have sung it myself.\"<ref name=\"harryp546\">{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Harry |authorlink=Bill Harry |title=The Beatles Encyclopedia: Revised and Updated |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0481-2 |page=546}}</ref> \n\nStructurally, it features hectic Bo Diddley rhythm and busy [[banjo]] style guitar playing in juxtaposition with Harrison's vocal. Its composers give it an unpredictable choice of chord (augmenting the B7th on \"I'm happy just to ''dance'' with you\") right at the crux of its title, jarring the chorus.<ref name=\"scores\">{{cite book |author=Hal Leonard Publishing Corporation |title=The Beatles - Complete Scores |year=1993 |publisher=Hal Leonard |location=Milwaukee |isbn=0-7935-1832-6 |page=492}}</ref>\n \n==Recording==\nThe Beatles recorded \"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\" on a Sunday, the first time they had used [[Abbey Road Studios]] on other than a normal work day.\n\nThe group also recorded a version for the BBC's ''From Us to You'' radio show. The session took place on 17 July 1964 at the BBC Paris Studio in London, and was first broadcast on 3 August that year.\n==Personnel==\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead guitar (1963 [[Rickenbacker 360/12]]), lead vocals\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 rhythm guitar (1964 [[Rickenbacker 325]]), backing vocals\n*[[Paul McCartney]] - bass guitar (1963 [[Hofner 500/1]]), backing vocals\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - drums\n*[[George Martin]] - producer\n*[[Norman Smith]] - engineer\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:B-sides]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on A Hard Day's Night]]\n[[Category:A Hard Day's Night (film)]]\n[[Category:Meet The Beatles]]"}}}]}}}}
