It was released two months earlier in the USA on the album ''[[Yesterday and Today]]'' and did not feature on the original U.S. version of ''Revolver''. The song was primarily written by [[John Lennon]] but, like all The Beatles' songs written by Lennon and [[Paul McCartney]], it is credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]].\n\n==Background==\nThe song has a unique sound, featuring a dual guitar solo by [[George Harrison]] played backwards, as well as an electronically compressed rhythm guitar track. The idea for the backwards solo was conceived after a tape operator accidentally threaded a tape into the machine the wrong way. The backwards guitar was written and performed by Harrison in a five hour late-night recording session with producer [[George Martin]]. To make the solo consistent with the rest of the song, Harrison had to practise the entire melody of his solo backwards so that when reversed and mixed in, it would fit the overall dreamlike mood of the rest of the song.<ref name=\"macdonaldp86\">MacDonald (2005), p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe psychedelic drone effect of the song was achieved by recording it at various speeds. The band also added other dreamlike touches, including alarm-clock-like vocal harmonies by McCartney and Harrison when Lennon sings \"Please don't wake me\" and during the break before the second bridge, at about 1:57 minutes into the song, a barely audible voice (probably Lennon's) can be heard saying, \"Yawn, Paul\", followed by a slightly more audible yawn at 2:00 minutes.\n\n==Interpretation==\nThe psychedelic sound, the hazy, disjointed mood and the dreamy lyrics of song, suggest Lennon is singing of being in a sleepy drug-induced state. The first draft of Lennon's lyrics for \"I'm Only Sleeping\", written on the back of a letter from 1966, suggest that he was writing about the joys of staying in bed rather than any drug euphoria. While not on tour, due to his lack of routine, Lennon would often spend his time sleeping, reading, writing or watching television, often under the influence of drugs, and would often have to be woken by McCartney for songwriting sessions. In a London ''Evening Standard'' article published on 4 March 1966, which contained quotes from an interview in which Lennon made his \"[[more popular than Jesus]]\" remark, [[Maureen Cleave]], a friend of Lennon's, wrote, \"He can sleep almost indefinitely, is probably the laziest person in England. 'Physically lazy,' he said. 'I don't mind writing or reading or watching or speaking, but sex is the only physical thing I can be bothered with any more.'\"<ref name=\"cleave\">{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/1966/03/04/how-does-a-beatle-live-by-maureen-cleave/ |title=How Does a Beatle Live?

Take 11 was chosen as the master and two days later, on 29 April, Lennon added his lead vocals. Five more takes of the song were also recorded but none were used. On 5 May, Harrison wrote and recorded the double guitar solo; one solo was recorded with fuzz effects, the other without. The next day, on 6 May, the song was completed with Lennon, McCartney and Harrison recording the backing vocals.\n\n==Release==\nThe song was first released on 20 June 1966 as track 2 on the U.S. album ''Yesterday And Today''. The song was later released on 5 August 1966 as track 3 on ''Revolver'', the album for which the song was originally intended. The U.S. version of ''Revolver'' did not feature the song due to the fact it had already been released in the country on a different album.\n\nThe mono and stereo versions of \"I'm Only Sleeping\" differ greatly in the positioning and tracking of the backwards guitar:\n*U.S. mono version: No backwards track during the second verse but a quick fragment is heard on the \"time\" in \"taking my time\" and \"ceiling\" in \"lying there and staring at the ceiling\". The track is fully intact during the instrumental break and continues into the words \"please don't\" in \"please don't spoil my day\". Near the end of the song, the backwards track starts four beats after the last word \"sleeping\".\n*U.S. rechannelled stereo version: This version was mixed from the U.S. mono version of the song but has far more reverb.\n*U.S. stereo version: Backwards track on \"everywhere at such a speed\" and \"find there's no need\". The track stops at the end of the solo and at the end of the song, starts immediately sfter the word \"sleeping\".\n*UK mono version: Backwards track on \"...where at such a speed,\" \"there's no need\" and \"staring at the ceiling\". The track stops at the end of the solo and at the end of the song, starts immediately after the word \"sleeping\".\n*UK stereo version: Backwards track on \"running everywhere at such a speed\" and \"till they find there's no need\". The track fades in two bars into the solo but continues into the word \"please\" in \"please don't spoil my day\". At the end of the song, the track starts immediately sfter the word \"sleeping\".\n\nSince the released of The Beatles music on CDs in 1987, the UK stereo version of the album has become the standard version in the U.S.\n\nPart of an instrumental rehearsal of the song featuring a vibraphone and the first take of the song from 29 April 1966, was released on the 1996 album ''[[Anthology 2]]''.\n\nThe UK mono version of ''Revolver'' was released on CD as part of the 2009 [[The Beatles in Mono]] remastered box set.\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 Lead and Harmony Vocals, Rhythm Guitar ([[Gibson J-160E]])\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 Harmony Vocals, Bass Guitar ([[Rickenbacker 4001S]])\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 Harmony Vocals, Rhythm Guitar ([[Gibson J-160E]]), Lead Guitar ([[Fender Stratocaster]])\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - Drums\n*[[George Martin]] - producer\n*[[Geoff Emerick]] - engineer\n\n==Cover versions==\n*Lobo covered the song on the album ''Just A Singer'', released in 1974.\n*\"I'm Only Sleeping\" was the first solo single by British singer Suggs, best known as the lead singer of Madness.
