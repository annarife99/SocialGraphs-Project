It was a humorous parody of the Ink Spots. It consists of Paul McCartney singing in a deep baritone, offset with shrill falsetto backing vocals by John Lennon, and guitar strumming. The lead vocal sings, in rather confused lyrics, about his determination of making a woman his; while the falsettos wail the last word of each sentence. About halfway through the song, Lennon gives a mock-bass voice spoken interlude about how, when the woman brought him toast one morning, he looked into her eyes and saw a \"National Health Eyeball\", then proceeded to love her like he has never done before. The song rises to a crescendo of wailing and bellowing, then fades out in laughter. To add to the confusion, the song is very difficult to understand; clicks, buzzes, fuzz, giggling, and the baritone voice obscure the lyrics.\n\nRecorded in the McCartney family bathroom in 1960, it is the earliest song attributed to the Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership to be officially released. Along with the other songs recorded on that day, it is one of the few known Beatles recordings to feature Stuart Sutcliffe on bass.\n\n== Personnel ==\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 lead vocal, guitar\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 backing and spoken vocals, guitar\n* [[George Harrison]] \u2013 guitar\n* [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] \u2013 bass\n: Personnel per Mark Lewisohn"}}}]}}}}
