It was included on [[The Beatles (album)|''The Beatles'']] album (also known as ''The White Album''). Harrison wrote the song as a tribute to his friend [[Eric Clapton]]'s chocolate addiction. George Harrison got the lyrics for this from the inside lid of a box of chocolates. Montelimar, Ginger Sling, Cream Tangerine, and Coffee Dessert were names of sweets in the Mackintosh \"Good News\" assortment. Supposedly all of the confectionery names are authentic except cherry cream and coconut fudge. The chorus, \"But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle\", is a reference to the deterioration of one's teeth after eating too many sweets. The line \"We all know Obla-di-bla-da\" refers to the song 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' which appears earlier on the album.\n==Recording==\nThe song's first take was recorded on 3 October 1968 and the final mixes were finished by 14 October 1968. Six saxophonists (three baritone, three tenor) were brought in and were reportedly displeased when George Harrison decided to distort their appearance on the album.\n==Credits==\n*George Harrison - Lead Vocals, Lead and Rhythm Guitar (1957 [[Gibson Les Paul Standard]]), Acoustic Guitar (Gibson J-200 Jumbo)\n*Paul McCartney - Harmony Vocals and Bass Guitar (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]])\n*Ringo Starr - Drums (1968 Ludwig Hollywood Maple) and Tambourine\n*Chris Thomas - Organ (Hammond RT-3 w/ Leslie 145 cabinet) and Electric Piano (Hohner Pianet C)\n*Art Ellefson - Tenor Saxophone\n*Danny Moss - Tenor Saxophone\n*Derek Collins - Tenor Saxophone\n*Ronnie Ross - Baritone Saxophone\n*Harry Klein - Baritone Saxophone\n*Bernard George - Baritone Saxophone\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/savoy-truffle/the-beatles Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:Songs written by George Harrison]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on The White Album]]"}}}]}}}}
