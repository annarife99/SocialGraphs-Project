George once commented on John's innate songwriting ability: \"John has an amazing thing with his timing - he always comes across with very different time signatures, you know. For example, on 'All You Need is Love' it just sort of skips a beat here and there and changes time. But when you question him as to what it is he's actually doing, he really doesn't know. He just does it naturally.\"\n*If the verb 'Loves' is ignored; the Beatles say the word Love 102 times in the song.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/all-you-need-is-love/magical-mystery-tour Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n\n[[Category:The Beatles singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on Magical Mystery Tour]]\n[[Category:Non-album singles]]"}}}]}}}}
