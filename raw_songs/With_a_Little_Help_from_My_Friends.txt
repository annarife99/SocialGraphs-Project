Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] in 1967. The song was written for and sung by [[Ringo Starr]]. Though being sung by all the Beatles in half the song, it is unfortunately only credited as [[Lennon/McCartney|Lennon-McCartney]].\n== Origins ==\n[[John Lennon|Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]] finished writing this song in mid-March 1967, written specifically as Starr's track for the album. It was briefly called Bad Finger Boogie (after Lennon had composed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having hurt his forefinger), later the inspiration for the band Badfinger. However, the notion that Lennon is responsible for the song's melody, as opposed to McCartney alone, or Lennon in collaboration with McCartney, is highly questionable in light of Lennon's remarks, in his 1980 Playboy interview, where he refers to 'With a Little Help from My Friends'\" by stating: \"This is Paul, with a little help from me. 'What do you see when you turn out the light/ I can't tell you, but I know it's mine...' is mine.\"\n\nLennon and McCartney deliberately wrote a tune with a limited range - except for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with Starr to achieve. Speaking in the [[Anthology]], Starr insisted on changing the first line which originally was \"What would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you throw ripe tomatoes at me?\" He changed the lyric so that fans would not throw tomatoes at him should he perform it live. (In the early days, after [[George Harrison]] made a passing comment that he liked jelly babies, the group was pelted with them at all of their live performances. (They were also pelted with jelly beans in the United States where jelly babies were not available.))\n\nThe song's composition is unusually well documented as Hunter Davies was present and described the writing process in the Beatles' official biography. The song reads like a conversation between the singer and a group of people. For example, \"Would you believe in love at first sight/Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time\". In the preceding quotation from the lyrics, the other three Beatles sing the first line, with Starr answering in the following one.\n\nThe band started recording the song the same day that they posed for the Sgt. Pepper album cover (30 March 1967). The session finished at 7:30 the following morning. This song also leads in from the title track of the album. The first lyric is \"Billy Shears\" which is the last lyric of the title track.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Segue]\n\nBilly Shears!\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nWhat would you think if I sang out of tune?\n\nWould you stand up and walk out on me?\n\nLend me your ears and I'll sing you a song\n\nAnd I'll try not to sing out of key\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOh, I get by with a little help from my friends\n\nMm, I get high with a little help from my friends\n\nMm, gonna try with a little help from my friends\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nWhat do I do when my love is away?\n\nDoes it worry you to be alone?\n\nHow do I feel by the end of the day?\n\nAre you sad because you're on your own?\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nNo, I get by with a little help from my friends\n\nMm, get high with a little help from my friends\n\nMm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nDo you need anybody?\n\nI need somebody to love\n\nCould it be anybody?\n\nI want somebody to love\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nWould you believe in a love at first sight?\n\nYes, I'm certain that it happens all the time\n\nWhat do you see when you turn out the light?\n\nI can't tell you, but I know it's mine\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOh, I get by with a little help from my friends\n\nMm, get high with a little help from my friends\n\nOh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nDo you need anybody?\n\nI just need someone to love\n\nCould it be anybody?\n\nI want somebody to love\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nOh, I get by with a little help from my friends\n\nMm, gonna try with a little help from my friends\n\nOh, I get high with a little help from my friends\n\nYes, I get by with a little help from my friends\n\nWith a little help from my friends\n\n==Instrumentation==\n* [[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 Lead Vocal, Drums (Ludwig Super Classic), Tambourine\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Piano (Challen Upright), Bass (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Backing Vocal\n* [[John Lennon]] - Cowbell, Guitar, Backing Vocal\n* [[George Harrison]] - Backing Vocal, Lead Guitar (1961 [[Fender Stratocaster]])\n* [[George Martin]] -  Hammond Organ (RT-3)\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Sgt.
