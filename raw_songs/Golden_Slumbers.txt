The song begins the progression that leads to the end of the album and is followed by \"[[Carry That Weight]].\" The two songs were recorded together as a single piece, and both were written by [[Paul McCartney]] (credited to Lennon/McCartney).\n\n==Recording==\nMcCartney was the lead vocalist. He begins the song in a soft tone appropriate for a lullaby, with piano, bass guitar, and string section accompaniment. Beginning with the line \"Golden slumbers fill your eyes...\", the drums come in and McCartney switches to a stronger tone, both of which emphasize the switch to the refrain. McCartney said, \"I remember trying to get a very strong vocal on it, because it was such a gentle theme, so I worked on the strength of the vocal on it, and ended up quite pleased with it.\"\n\nThe main recording session for \"Golden Slumbers\"/\"Carry That Weight\" was on 2 July 1969. [[John Lennon]] was not present. He was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Scotland on 1 July 1969 and was hospitalized there until 6 July.\n\nAdditional vocals were added in an overdub session on 30 July 1969, the same day the first trial edit of the side two medley was created. Lennon did participate in this session. On 15 August, orchestral overdubs were made to \"Golden Slumbers\" and five other songs on Abbey Road.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\n\nOnce, there was a way to get back homeward\n\nOnce, there was a way to get back home\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nSleep, pretty darling, do not cry\n\nAnd I will sing a lullaby\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\n\nGolden slumbers fill your eyes\n\nSmiles awake you when you rise\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nSleep, pretty darling, do not cry\n\nAnd I will sing a lullaby\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\n\nOnce, there was a way to get back homeward\n\nOnce, there was a way to get back home\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nSleep, pretty darling, do not cry\n\nAnd I will sing a lullaby\n\n==Credits==\n\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - lead vocals, piano, arrangement, conductor\n*[[George Harrison]] - bass (1966 [[Fender Jazz Bass]])\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - drums, timpani\n*Unnamed session players - strings, brass\n*[[George Martin]] - arrangement, conductor\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/golden-slumbers/abbey-road Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Abbey Road]]"}}}]}}}}
