In the United States, \"All I've Got to Do\" originally appeared on ''[[Meet The Beatles!]]''. According to Dennis Alstrand, this song is the first time in rock and roll or rock music where the bass player plays chords as a vital part of the song.\n\n==Inspiration==\nLennon said he was \"trying to do Smokey Robinson again,\" and [[Ian MacDonald]] compared it to \"You Can Depend on Me\" by the Miracles, both musically and lyrically. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic said it sounds like Robinson but also Arthur Alexander. Beatles biographer Bob Spitz said the song is \"restlessly dark and moody\", and compared it to The Shirelles' \"[[Baby It's You]]\" (a song The Beatles previously covered) and early Drifters recordings.\n\nIt was one of three songs Lennon wrote solo for ''With The Beatles'', with \"[[It Won't Be Long]]\" and \"[[Not a Second Time]]\". Lennon said that it was written specifically for the American market; the idea of calling a girl on the telephone was unthinkable to a British youth in the early 1960s. For instance, Lennon said in an interview regarding \"[[No Reply]]\": \"I had the image of walking down the street and seeing her silhouetted in the window and not answering the 'phone, although I have never called a girl on the 'phone in my life! Because 'phones weren't part of the English child's life.\"\n\n==Recording==\nThe Beatles recorded the song in a single recording session on 11 September 1963 in 14 takes with one overdub, take 15. The master take was take 15. It was mixed for mono on 30 September and for stereo on 29 October.\n\nAlthough music journalist Steve Turner claims the song was written in 1961, MacDonald said the song was never in the Beatles' live repertoire, and that explains why 8 of the 14 takes were incomplete: the band was unfamiliar with the song.\n\nMusicologist Alan W. Pollack suggests that the hummed fade-out verse is more than just a convenient way to make the ending different. He says, \"[I]t rather effectively drives home the underlying self-satisfied subtext of the lyrics; to the extent that some things in life, such as the comfortable equilibrium of a relationship [defy] adequate expression in words.\"\n\n==Release==\nIn the UK, \"All I've Got to Do\" was released on ''With The Beatles'' which also includes the Beatles' cover of \"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\" by the Miracles, the most direct connection between the album and Robinson's music. In the US, [[Capitol Records]] pulled \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\" off ''Meet the Beatles!'', releasing it later on ''[[The Beatles' Second Album]]''.\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar ([[Rickenbacker 325|1958 Rickenbacker 325]])\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 backing vocal, bass guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1961 Hofner 500/1]])\n* [[George Harrison]] \u2013 backing vocal, lead guitar ([[Grestch Country Gentleman|1962 Gretsch 6122 Country Gentleman]])\n* [[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 drums\n\n* Personnel per Ian MacDonald{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=97}}\n\n== Cover versions ==\n*In 2007, The Smithereens covered \"All I've Got to Do\"-and all the other songs on ''Meet the Beatles!''-on their tribute album ''Meet the Smithereens!''.\n*Toxic Audio covered in on ''Come Together: An A Capella Tribute to The Beatles''.\n*Moon Martin recorded it on ''Shots from a Cold Nightmare'' (1979) with Phil Seymour on drums and harmony.\n*Ian McNabb and Thomas McConnell covered it on ''Mojo: We're With The Beatles'' (2013).\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on With the Beatles]]"}}}]}}}}
