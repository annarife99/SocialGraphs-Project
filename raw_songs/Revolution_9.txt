Entirely composed of random voices, songs and snippets of noise, it was a creation made solely by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]], with [[George Harrison]] assisting at times; The other band members and [[George Martin]] hated it.\n\nLennon said it represented an image he tried to paint of revolution. It was inspired by several other [[Wikipedia:Avant-garde|Avant-garde]] types of music. It was first conceived as an additional coda to [[Revolution]]. This became its own project after Lennon had added sound effects and reversed audio. It runs for a total of eight minutes, the longest project released by [[The Beatles]].\n\nReception to the track is varied: From an \"embarrassment\" to \"anti-masterpiece\" to \"beautifully organized,\" fans and critics are divided on the nature of the track, some fully hating it, others enjoying it.\n\nIt has also been interpreted different ways. Some saw connections to the [[Paul is dead]] theory, and [[Charles Manson]] has seen it as an example of his \"Helter Skelter\" scenario, in which an interracial war will take place. Some simply dismiss it as garbage.\n\n== Background and recording ==\n\"Revolution 9\" is one of few Beatles experimental tracks, the other being \"[[Carnival of Light]]\", done by [[Paul McCartney]] during \"[[Penny Lane]]\" recording sessions. Both Lennon and McCartney had inspiration from [[Wikipedia:Karlheinz Stockhausen|Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and his work titled [[Wikipedia:Hymnen|Hymnen]] can be seen as inspiration for the song. [[Yoko Ono]] was also a powerful influence on Lennon; Their previous and first work together, ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins]]'', was similar to \"Revolution 9\". Lennon was intrigued by the screams and random talk of Ono, so he let her pick which tapes to use.\n\nThe first bits of \"Revolution 9\" came from a recording session for \"Revolution\", which was just simply Lennon and a guitar. It soon evolved into a ten-minute \"jam\" with Lennon screaming \"Alright!\" and Ono occasionally speaking at times, like as saying, \"You become naked.\" This recording session became two projects: The first part became \"[[Revolution 1]]\", and the second transforming into \"Revolution 9\". He began to mix tapes of random noises supplied from EMI and began mixing it in until the STEED system ran out. Additional sound was added later with George Harrison assisting.\n\nFinal overdubs took place on June 21, and Lennon himself mixed the audio into stereo and mono. When the project was completed, McCartney returned from holiday, as he had been gone during most of the process. Dissatisfied, McCartney tried to persuade Lennon to drop the song from the album; He refused.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Spoken]\n\n(Bottle of Claret for you if I had realised?)\n\n(Well, do it next time)\n\n(I forgot about it, George, I\u2019m sorry)\n\n(Will you forgive me?)\n\n(Mmm... yes)\n\n(Cheeky bitch!)\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nNumber 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nThen there\u2019s this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants\n\nAbout the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire\n\nEveryone of them knew that as time went by\n\nThey\u2019d get a little bit older and a litter slower but\n\nIt\u2019s all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who\u2019s always\n\nUmpteen your father\u2019s giving it diddly-i-dee\n\nDistrict was leaving, intended to pay for\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nNumber 9, number 9\n\n\n[Refrain]\n\nWho's to know?\n\nWho was to know?\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nNumber 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nI sustained nothing worse than\n\nAlso for example\n\nWhatever you\u2019re doing\n\nA business deal falls through\n\nI informed him on the third night\n\nWhen fortune gives\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nNumber 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nRight!
