Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] album, in [[1967]].\n==Inspiration==\n\nThe song, which was written by [[John Lennon]], was inspired by a 19th century poster (about 1843), which he had found in an antique store in Surrey. Many of the elements in the song are based off of the poster.\n\nIt is commonly believed that the line \"And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz\" was a reference to the drug heroin (as both \"henry\" and \"horse\" are slang names for it); the original line on the poster referred to the horse as Zanthus.\n\nThe real Mr. Kite was an all-round performer who worked with Panquo Fanque and Mr J. Henderson, who was employed as a wire walker, trampolinist (somerset thrower, according to the poster) and clown.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse 1]\n\nFor the benefit of Mr. Kite\n\nThere will be a show tonight on trampoline\n\nThe Hendersons will all be there\n\nLate of Pablo Fanques Fair \n\nWhat a scene\n\nOver men and horses, hoops and garters\n\nLastly through a hogshead of real fire\n\nIn this way Mr. K. will challenge the world\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nThe celebrated Mr. K.\n\nPerforms his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate\n\nThe Hendersons will dance and sing\n\nAs Mr. Kite flies through the ring \n\nDon't be late\n\nMessrs. K and H. assure the public\n\nTheir production will be second to none\n\nAnd of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nThe band begins at ten to six\n\nWhen Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound\n\nAnd Mr. H. will demonstrate\n\nTen summer sets he'll undertake \n\nOn solid ground\n\nHaving been some days in preparation\n\nA splendid time is guaranteed for all\n\nAnd tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[John Lennon]] - Lead And Backing Vocals, Organ (1963 Hammond L-100), Chord Harmonica (Hohner Chromatic Bass Harmonica), Tape Loops\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Bass Guitar (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Reverse Lead Guitar (1964 Fender Esquire), Backing Vocals\n* [[George Harrison]] - Maracas, Bass Harmonica (Hohner Chromatic Bass Harmonica)\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - Drums (1964 Ludwig Super Classic Black Oyster Pearl), Tambourine\n* [[George Martin]] - Piano (1964 Hamburg Steinway Baby Grand), Harmonium (Mannborg Harmonium), Hammond Organ (Hammond RT-3), Wurlitzer Organ, Glockenspiel, Tape Loops\n* [[Mal Evans]] - Harmonica (Hohner Cromatic)\n* [[Neil Aspinall]] - Harmonica (Hohner Cromatic)\n* Geoff Emerick - Tape Loops\n{{stub}}\n[[Category:1967 songs]]\n[[Category:John Lennon compositions]]\n[[Category:Sgt.
