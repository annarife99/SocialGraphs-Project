[[John Lennon]], who wrote the song, is the primary lead singer. Like all songs by either Lennon or [[Paul McCartney]] it is credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]].\n\n==Recording==\nThe song was recorded at Abbey Road on 8 October 1968 and was completed including all overdubs in this one session. The Beatles also started and completed the Lennon-composed '[[I'm So Tired]]' during the same recording session.\n\n==Inspiration==\nThis song mocks the actions of a young American named Richard A. Cooke III, known as Rik who was visiting his mother, Nancy Cooke de Herrera, at the [[Wikipedia:Ashram|ashram]] of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in Rishikesh at the same time that the Beatles were staying with the Maharishi. According to his mother, both she and her son maintained friendly relations with all of the Beatles except for Lennon, who by Cooke de Herrera's account was \"a genius\" but distant and contemptuous of the wealthy American Cooke de Herrera and her clean-cut, college-attending son. According to Nancy's life account, ''Beyond Gurus'', the genesis of the song occurred when she, Rik, and several others, including native guides, set out upon elephants to hunt for a tiger (allegedly presented by their Indian guide as a traditional act). The pack of elephants was attacked by a tiger, which was shot by Rik. Rik was initially proud of his quick reaction and posed for a photograph with his prize. However, Rik's reaction to the slaying was mixed, as he has not hunted since. Nancy claims that all present recognised the necessity of Rik's action, but that John Lennon's reaction was scornful and sarcastic, asking Rik: \"But wouldn't you call that slightly life-destructive?\" The song was written by Lennon as mocking what he saw as Rik's bravado and unenlightened attitude.{{sfn|Cabrera|2009}}\n\nLennon later told his version of the story in a ''Playboy'' interview, stating that: \"\u2018Bungalow Bill\u2019 was written about a guy in Maharishi's meditation camp who took a short break to go shoot a few poor tigers, and then came back to commune with God. There used to be a character called Jungle Jim, and I combined him with Buffalo Bill. It's sort of a teenage social-comment song and a bit of a joke.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=199}} [[Mia Farrow]], who was also at the ashram during the period supports Lennon's story in her autobiography; she writes, \"Then a self-important, middle-aged American woman arrived, moving a mountain of luggage into the brand-new private bungalow next to Maharishi's along with her son, a bland young man named Bill. People fled this newcomer, and no one was sorry when she left the ashram after a short time to go tiger hunting, unaware that their presence had inspired a new Beatles song \u2014 'Bungalow Bill.'\"{{sfn|Farrow|1997|p=139}}\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Chorus]\n\nHey, Bungalow Bill\n\nWhat did you kill, Bungalow Bill?\n\nHey, Bungalow Bill\n\nWhat did you kill, Bungalow Bill?\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nHe went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun\n\nIn case of accidents he always took his mum\n\nHe's the all American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son\n\nAll the children sing\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHey, Bungalow Bill\n\nWhat did you kill, Bungalow Bill?\n\nHey, Bungalow Bill\n\nWhat did you kill, Bungalow Bill?\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nDeep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies\n\nBill and his elephants were taken by surprise\n\nSo Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes, zap!\n\nAll the children sing\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHey, Bungalow Bill\n\nWhat did you kill, Bungalow Bill?\n\nHey, Bungalow Bill\n\nWhat did you kill, Bungalow Bill?\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nThe children asked him if to kill was not a sin\n\n\"Not when he looked so fierce\", his mummy butted in\n\nIf looks could kill it would have been us instead of him\n\nAll the children sing\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHey, Bungalow Bill\n\nWhat did you kill, Bungalow Bill?\n\nHey, Bungalow Bill\n\nWhat did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
