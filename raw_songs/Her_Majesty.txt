It was originally part of the side two medley, appearing between \"[[Mean Mr. Mustard]]\" and \"[[Polythene Pam]]\" on the group\u2019s final recorded album, [[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]. McCartney disliked the way the medley sounded when it included \"Her Majesty\", so he had the medley re-edited to remove it. However, second engineer John Kurlander had been instructed never to throw out anything, so after the group left the recording studio that day, he picked it up off the floor, spliced 14 seconds of red leader tape onto the final mix reel, and then spliced in \"Her Majesty\" immediately after the leader tape. The box of the album's master reel had a notation stating to leave \"Her Majesty\" off the final product, but the next day when Malcolm Davies at Apple received the tape, he (also trained not to throw anything away) cut a playback lacquer of the whole sequence, including \"Her Majesty\". The Beatles liked this effect and left it on the album. On the first printing of the LP cover, \"Her Majesty\" is not listed, although it is shown on the record label. \"Her Majesty\" opens with the final, crashing chord of \"Mean Mr. Mustard\", while the final note of \"Her Majesty\" remained buried in the mix of \"Polythene Pam\". This was the result of \"Her Majesty\" being snipped off the reel during a rough mix of the medley. The cut in the medley was subsequently disguised with further mixing although \"Her Majesty\" was not touched again and still appears in its rough mix. Her majesty was a forgotten song on abbey road, but still beautiful as untouched.\n<br />\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse]\n\nHer Majesty's a pretty nice girl\n\nBut doesn't have a lot to say\n\nHer Majesty's a pretty nice girl\n\nBut she changes from day to day\n\nI want to tell her I love her a lot \n\nBut I got a bellyful of wine\n\nHer Majesty's a pretty nice girl\n\nSomeday I'm gonna make her mine (oh yeah\n\nSomeday I'm gonna make her mine\n<br />\n==Credits==\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - lead vocals, guitar (1967 [[Martin D-28]])\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/her-majesty/abbey-road Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on Abbey Road]]"}}}]}}}}
