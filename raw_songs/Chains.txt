In 1962 it was a hit for Little Eva's backing singers, The Cookies (#17 U.S. Pop, #7 R&B), and later covered by The Beatles.\n\n== The Beatles' version ==\nThe single by the Cookies was a popular cover song for Liverpool bands after its release in November 1962, and was included briefly in the Beatles live sets. They recorded it on February 11, 1963 in four takes (first has been proved the best) for inclusion on their British debut, ''Please Please Me''. Lennon played the introduction on the harmonica. Music critic Ian MacDonald criticized the Beatles' performance, writing that it was \"slightly out-of-tune\" and \"lacked spontaneity\". George Harrison sings the lead vocals on the Beatles' version; and, as the fourth track from the group's first album, it represents the first time many fans heard Harrison singing lead on a commercially released song.\n\nThey played the song live on a number of BBC radio shows, including ''Side by Side'', ''Here We Go'' and ''Pop Go the Beatles'' (though none of these performances were included on the 1994 compilation ''[[Live at the BBC]]'', it was eventually released on the 2013 compilation ''[[On Air - Live at the BBC Volume 2]]'').\n\n== Personnel ==\n===Cookies' version===\n*Earl-Jean McCrea: lead vocals\n*Margaret Ross: background vocals\n*Dorothy Jones: background vocals\n*Eva Boyd: background vocals\n\n===Beatles' version===\n*[[George Harrison]]: lead vocals, lead guitar (1957 [[Gretsch Duo Jet]])\n*[[John Lennon]]: backing vocals, rhythm guitar (1958 Rickenbacker 325), harmonica\n*[[Paul McCartney]]: backing vocals, bass guitar (1961 [[Hofner 500/1]])\n*[[Ringo Starr]]: drums (1960 Premeir 58/54 Mahogany)\n\nEngineered by [[Norman Smith]]\n\nPersonnel per Ian MacDonald\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Please Please Me]]\n[[Category:Cover Songs]]\n[[Category:Meet The Beatles]]"}}}]}}}}
