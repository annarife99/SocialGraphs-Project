Regardless, it is credited to Lennon/McCartney. Lennon and McCartney sang the song as a duet. It was written for Linda Eastman, McCartney's soon to be wife, though it sounds at times as if it is addressing Lennon, whose relationship with McCartney was tense at that time.\n\n\"Two of Us\" was originally released on Let It Be and was later released on Anthology 3 and Let It Be\u2026 Naked.\n\n==Overview==\n\"Two of Us\" originally began as a rocker with a strong \"Peggy Sue\" drum beat. In the Let It Be film, McCartney and Lennon sing the song \"rocker\" style into the same mic. The song lost its rock leanings as Paul worked out the composition over January 1969, and it became a more introspective song. The Beatles performed a finished version of the song live at Apple Studios on 31 January 1969; this performance was included in both the Let it Be film and album.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Intro]\n\n(\"I Dig A Pygmy\" by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids.)\n\n(Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats.)\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nTwo of us riding nowhere\n\nSpending someone's\n\nHard earned pay\n\nYou and me Sunday driving\n\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nTwo of us riding nowhere\n\nSpending someone's\n\nHard earned pay\n\nYou and me Sunday driving\n\nNot arriving\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOn our way back home\n\nWe're on our way home\n\nWe're on our way home\n\nWe're going home\n\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nTwo of us sending postcards\n\nWriting letters\n\nOn my wall\n\nYou and me burning matches\n\nLifting latches\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOn our way back home\n\nWe're on our way home\n\nWe're on our way home\n\nWe're going home\n\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n\nYou and I have memories\n\nLonger than the road that stretches out ahead\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\nTwo of us wearing raincoats\n\nStanding solo\n\nIn the sun\n\nYou and me chasing paper\n\nGetting nowhere\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOn our way back home\n\nWe're on our way home\n\nWe're on our way home\n\nWe're going home\n\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n\nYou and I have memories\n\nLonger than the road that stretches out ahead\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\nTwo of us wearing raincoats\n\nStanding solo\n\nIn the sun\n\nYou and me chasing paper\n\nGetting nowhere\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOn our way back home\n\nWe're on our way home\n\nWe're on our way home\n\nWe're going home\n\n\n[Outro]\n\n(We're going home.) \n\n(You better believe it.) \n\n(Goodbye.)\n\n== Credits ==\n\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Lead Vocals,  Acoustic Guitar (1967 [[Martin D-28]])\n* [[John Lennon]] - Lead Vocals, Guitar (1962 [[Gibson J-160E]])\n* [[George Harrison]] - Lead Guitar As Bass (1968 [[Fender Telecaster|Fender Rosewood Telecaster]])\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - Drums (1968 Ludwig Hollywood Maple)\n\n==Intro==\nAt the beginning of the recording Lennon shouts,\n\n\"'I Dig a Pygmy', by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids...
