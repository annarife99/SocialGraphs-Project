The song was later released as the tenth track on the American-only album [[Yesterday and Today]]. It is the only song credited to '''Lennon/McCartney/Starkey'''.\nRichie Unterberger, in Allmusic, says the song is an enjoyable, but lightweight, country & western-flavored entry in the Beatles catalog. Unterberger praises George Harrison's guitar work, which \"again marks him as the finest disciple of Carl Perkins,\" and the guitar work is indeed similar to \"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\", a Perkins cover version the Beatles released on Beatles for Sale.\n==Credits==\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 Lead Vocals, Drums\n*<blockquote>[[John Lennon]] \u2013 Rhythm Guitar (1961 [[Fender Stratocaster]]) or (1964 [[Rickenbacker 325]]), Harmony Vocals</blockquote>\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 Bass Guitar (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Harmony Vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] - Lead Guitar (1963 [[Grestch Tennessean]])\n:\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]"}}}]}}}}
