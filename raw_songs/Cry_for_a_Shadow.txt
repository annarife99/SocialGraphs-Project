It was recorded on June 22, [[1961]] at the Friedrich-Ebert-Halle, Hamburg-Harburg, Germany while they were performing as [[Tony Sheridan]]'s backup band for a few tracks.\n\n\n\n==Composition==\nIt was written by [[George Harrison]] with [[John Lennon]] as a parody of The Shadows' style. (The Shadows, who backed Cliff Richard, were the biggest British instrumental rock & roll group at the time of the recording.) It imitates the lead guitar with typical Hank Marvin licks, the melodic bass fills, and even has an imitation during the second middle 8 of the famous Jet Harris yell. It is the only Beatles track to be credited to Lennon and Harrison alone.\n\n==Release==\nIt was intended to be released as the b-side of \"''[[Why]]''\", another Sheridan song with The Beatles, but the record company chose to release another song instead. In early [[1964]], as The Beatles were gaining popularity, the record company Polydor decided to release it, with \"Why\" changed to the b-side. According to Bill Harry, editor of the Mersey Beat newspaper, Cry for a Shadow's original title was \"Beatle Bop\".\n\nIt was also released in [[1995]] as part of the [[Anthology 1]] compilation.\n\n==Credits==\n[[John Lennon]] \u2013 rhythm guitar (1958 Rickenbacker 325)<br />\n[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 bass, vocal scream<br />\n[[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead guitar (1957 Gretsch Duo Jet)<br />\n[[Pete Best]] \u2013 drums<br />\n[[Category:Instumentals]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by George Harrison]]\n[[Category:John Lennon compositions]]"}}}]}}}}
