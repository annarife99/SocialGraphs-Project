The song, one of Harrison's best-known Beatles contributions alongside \"[[Something]]\", originated from a songwriting collaboration between Harrison and close friend Eric Clapton called \"Badge,\" recorded by Clapton's group Cream, and featuring an arpeggiated guitar riff that is similar to the one that forms the bridge of \"Here Comes the Sun\". 1969 was a difficult year for Harrison: he was arrested for marijuana possession, he had his tonsils removed, and he had temporarily quit the band. The song was written while Harrison was away from all of these troubles.\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"Here Comes the Sun\" at London's EMI Studios in the summer of 1969. Led by Harrison's acoustic guitar, the track features Moog synthesizer, which he had introduced to the band's sound after acquiring an early model of the instrument in California. Reflecting the continued influence of Indian classical music on Harrison's writing, the composition includes several time signature changes.\n\n\"Here Comes the Sun\" has received acclaim from music critics. Combined with his other contribution to ''Abbey Road'', \"Something\", it gained for Harrison the level of recognition as a songwriter that had previously been reserved for his bandmates [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Harrison played the song during many of his relatively rare live performances as a solo artist, including at the Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 and, with Paul Simon, during his appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1976. Richie Havens and Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel each had hit singles with \"Here Comes the Sun\" in the 1970s. Nina Simone, George Benson, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, Peter Tosh and Joe Brown are among the many other artists who have covered the song.\n== Recording ==\nHarrison sang lead vocals and played acoustic guitar, Moog, and handclaps. [[Paul McCartney]] sang backing vocals, played bass guitar, and handclaps. [[Ringo Starr]] played drums and handclaps. [[John Lennon]] did not contribute to the song as he was recovering from a recent car crash and uncredited musicians played violas, cellos, double bass, piccolos, flutes, alto flutes, and clarinets. Harrison capoed his guitar on the 7th fret, resulting the final key of A major. He also used the same technique on his 1965 song \"[[If I Needed Someone]],\" which shares a similar melodic pattern. Harrison, McCartney and Starr recorded the rhythm track in 13 takes on 7 July 1969. Towards the end of the session Harrison spent an hour re-recording his acoustic guitar part. The following day he taped his lead vocals, and he and McCartney twice recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound. A harmonium and handclaps were added on 16 July. Harrison's guitar solo was overdubbed on 6 August, and the orchestral parts were added on 15 August. \"Here Comes The Sun\" was completed four days later with the addition of Harrison's Moog part. This song was originally proposed by Carl Sagan to be part of the Voyager Golden Record sent to space in 1977. While the Beatles agreed with this, Sagan was unable to form a definite agreement with Apple Records prior to the spacecraft's launch date.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Chorus]\n\nHere comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo \n\nHere comes the sun\n\nAnd I say \n\nIt's all right\n\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nLittle darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter\n\nLittle darling, it feels like years since it's been here\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHere comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo \n\nHere comes the sun\n\nAnd I say \n\nIt's all right\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nLittle darling, the smiles returning to the faces\n\nLittle darling, it seems like years since it's been here\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHere comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo \n\nHere comes the sun\n\nAnd I say \n\nIt's all right\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\n\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\n\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\n\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\n\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nLittle darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting\n\nLittle darling, it seems like years since it's been clear\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHere comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo \n\nHere comes the sun\n\nAnd I say \n\nIt's all right\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nHere comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo \n\nHere comes the sun\n\nIt's all right\n\nIt's all right\n\n==Credits==\n\n*[[File:The beatles here comes the sun.jpg|thumb|[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]] sheet music cover]][[George Harrison]] - Lead and Backing Vocals, Acoustic Guitar (1968 [[Gibson J-200]]), Lead Guitar (1968 [[Fender Telecaster]]), Moog Synthesizer, Handclaps\n*[[Paul McCartney]] - Backing Vocals, Bass Guitar (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]]) and Handclaps\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - Drums and Handclaps\n*[[File:Here Comes the Yellow Submarine.jpg|thumb|[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] fan art with Here Comes the Sun references and lyrics]]Unknown - Four Violas,Four Cellos,Double Bass,Two Piccolos,Two Flutes,Two Alto Flutes and Two Clarinets\n[[Category:Songs written by George Harrison]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Abbey Road]]"}}}]}}}}
