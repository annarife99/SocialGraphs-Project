The ''Abbey Road'' version was recorded with \"[[Sun King]]\" in one continuous piece.\n==Composition==\nWritten in India, Lennon said that the song was inspired by a newspaper story about a miser who concealed his cash wherever he could in order to prevent people from forcing him to spend it. On reflection, he didn't think highly of the composition, describing it in ''[[The Beatles Anthology|Anthology]]'' as \"a bit of crap I wrote in India.\"\n\nA demo version of the song was recorded in May 1968 at Kinfauns, [[George Harrison]]'s home in Esher, and appears on [[Anthology 3]]. In that version, Mustard's sister is named Shirley. Lennon changed it to Pam when he saw the opportunity to ease the segue into the song \"[[Polythene Pam]]\", which follows \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" on the album. According to Lennon, \"In 'Mean Mr. Mustard', I said 'his sister Pam'\u2014originally it was 'his sister Shirley' in the lyric. I changed it to Pam to make it sound like it had something to do with it.\" Additionally, the original version of the song was a quieter acoustic rendition and was over 4 minutes in length.\n\n== Lyrics ==\n[Verse 1]\n\nMean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park\n\nShaves in the dark trying to save paper\n\nSleeps in a hole in the road\n\nSaving up to buy some clothes\n\nKeeps a ten-bob note up his nose\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nSuch a mean old man\n\nSuch a mean old man\n\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nHis sister Pam works in a shop\n\nShe never stops, she\u2019s a go-getter\n\nTakes him out to look at the queen\n\nOnly place that he\u2019s ever been\n\nAlways shouts out something obscene\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nSuch a dirty old man\n\nDirty old man\n\n==Other versions==\nThe version in the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' film was performed by Mean Mr. Mustard (played by Frankie Howerd) and his evil robot companions named the Computerettes. As with the performance of \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\" also in the film, the computerized singing of the Computerettes was performed by the Bee Gees.\n\n==Credits==\n*[[John Lennon]] -  piano (1905 Steinway Vertegrand), rhythm guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]]), lead vocals\n*[[Paul McCartney]] - fuzz bass (1966 [[Fender Jazz Bass]]), harmony vocals\n*[[George Harrison]] - lead guitar (1957 [[Gibson Les Paul Standard]])\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - drums (1968 Ludwig Hollywood Maple), tambourine\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/mean-mr-mustard/abbey-road Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:Songs on Abbey Road]]"}}}]}}}}
