His version was released as a single by Dot Records on September 17, 1962. A cover version was performed by The Beatles and included on their 1963 debut album ''Please Please Me''. \n\n==Background==\nAccording to Richie Unterberger, music critic for Allmusic:\n{{quote|'Anna' was one of the great early soul ballads, even if its loping groove was closer to a mid-tempo song than a slow ballad. Like several of Alexander's songs, it would come to be more famous in its cover version than through its original release. And it was actually a small hit when it first came out in 1962, getting to #68 in the pop charts and #10 in the R&B listings.<ref name=\"amg-anna-review\">{{cite web |first=Richie |last=Unterberger |authorlink=Richie Unterberger |url={{Allmusic |class=song |id=t495124 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Review of \"Anna (Go to Him)\" |publisherAllmusic |accessdate=March 18, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"amg-anna-charts\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p3519/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} |title=Arthur Alexander Billboard Singles |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=March 18, 2007}}</ref>}}\n\nDespite the title, throughout the song the lyric is \"go ''with'' him\" rather than \"go ''to'' him\".\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn the ''Married... with Children'' episode \"Oldies But Young 'Uns\" (Season 5, Episode 17; airdate March 17, 1991), Al Bundy becomes obsessed with finding out the name of this song which has become his earworm (originally he can only tell people the nondescript misheard lyric \"hmm hmm him\").\n\n== The Beatles' version ==\nA personal favourite of [[John Lennon]],<ref name=\"harryp28-29\">{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Harry |authorlink=Bill Harry |title=The Beatles Encyclopedia: Revised and Updated |year=2000 |pages=28\u201329 |publisher=Virgin Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0481-2}}</ref>, it became part of [[The Beatles]]' early repertoire and was consequently recorded by them for their 1963 debut album, ''[[Please Please Me (album)|Please Please Me]]''<ref name=\"lewisohn1p200\">{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Lewisohn |authorlink=Mark Lewisohn |title=The Beatles Recording Sessions |year=1988 |publisher=Harmony Books |location=New York |isbn=0-517-57066-1 |page=200}}</ref>.
