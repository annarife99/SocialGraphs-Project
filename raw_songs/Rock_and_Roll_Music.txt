The Beatles performed the song in many of their early Hamburg shows, and also played it on the BBC show ''[[Pop Go The Beatles]]''. In late 1964, exhausted from non-stop touring and recording and short of original material, they decided to record several of their old rock and rhythm and blues favourites to fill out their LP release ''[[Beatles for Sale]]''. Among these was a version of Berry's tune that eventually became as well-known as the original. The lead vocal in The Beatles' version was performed by [[John Lennon]]. In contrast to Berry's even-toned rendition, Lennon sang it as loudly and dynamically as his voice would permit. In the USA, it was released on the LP ''[[Beatles '65]]''.  \n\nIt also served as the title song to The Beatles' 1976 compilation album, ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Music (album)|Rock 'n' Roll Music]]''.\n\nThe Beatles' version of \"Rock and Roll Music\" was released as a single in some countries, and topped the charts in Norway, The Netherlands (double a-side with ''[[No Reply]]'') and Australia.\n\n==Personnel==\n\n**[[John Lennon]] \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1964 Rickenbacker 325), piano\n*[[Paul McCartney]] - bass guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1963 Hofner 500/1]]), piano\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead guitar (Gretsch Tennessean)\n*[[Ringo Starr]] - drums\n*[[George Martin]] - piano\n\n{{song stub}}\n\n[[ru:Rock and Roll Music]]\n[[Category:Cover Songs]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Beatles for Sale]]\n[[Category:1964 songs]]"}}}]}}}}
