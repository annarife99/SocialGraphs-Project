Although credited to [[Lennon/McCartney]], it was composed entirely by [[Paul McCartney]]. Despite the similarity of title, the song is unrelated to \"[[Wild Honey Pie]]\".\n\n==Interpretation==\n\nThe song is a direct homage to the British music-hall style. It concerns a famed actress, known through the hypocorism \"Honey Pie\", who becomes famous in the United States, and her old lover, who wishes for her to rejoin him in England. The premise &ndash; a humble admirer yearning for the return of his lover &ndash; is not unlike a typical music-hall plot. In order to establish an appropriate, old-timey sound, 'scratches' were added to the third line, \"Now she's hit the big time!\" from a 78 RPM record.\n\n==Recording==\nThe Beatles began recording \"Honey Pie\" on 1 October 1968, at Trident Studios in London's Wardour Street.\n\nJust one take was recorded on the first day, although it is likely that a number of rehearsal attempts had previously been recorded and wiped. The next day, McCartney taped his lead vocals, and a lead guitar part was added. According to [[George Harrison]], [[John Lennon]] played the guitar solo.<ref>http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/honey-pie/</ref>\n\n==Cover versions==\n\nThe song has been covered by [[Alan Klein]] (1969), [[Barbra Streisand]], the [[The King's Singers|King's Singers]], [[The Golden Gate Quartet]], [[Tuck & Patti]], and [[John Pizzarelli]], among others. Perhaps the strangest version was performed by [[Dom DeLuise]] in the 1978 film {C \n[[Sextette]] (which included the comic tapdancing on a piano).\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Paul McCartney]] &ndash; Lead Vocals and Piano (Bechstein Grand #44064)\n* [[John Lennon]] - Lead and Rhythm Guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]])\n*[[George Harrison]] &ndash; Six-String Bass Guitar (1968 [[Fender Bass VI]])\n*[[Ringo Starr]] &ndash; Drums (1968 Ludwig Hollywood Maple)\n*[[George Martin]] &ndash; Clarinet Arrangement\n*Dennis Walton, Ronald Chamberlain, Jim Chester, Rex Morris and Harry Klein - Saxophones\n* Raymond Newman and David Smith - Clarinets\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/honey-pie/ The Beatles Bible: Honey Pie]\n*[http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/hp.shtml Alan W.
