The song was originally by American singer Barrett Strong. The Beatles' version is featured as the closing track on their album ''[[With the Beatles]]''.\n\n== About ==\n\nThe song was the only hit for Barrett Strong, who wrote many classic songs with fellow Motown writer Norman Whitfield, including \"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\" by Marvin Gaye, \"War\" by Edwin Starr and \"Papa Was A Rolling Stone\" by The Temptations. This was also the biggest hit on Anna Records, a label formed by Berry Gordy's sister, Anna. It was later released on Gordy's Tamla label, which became Motown Records. It was the first hit single for Tamla. Berry Gordy wrote this with Janie Bradford, who contributed to Motown as a writer and in an administrative role. She and Gordy had previously written two songs for Jackie Wilson's first album.\n\n\"Money\" was a popular cover tune in the early-mid 1960s. The Rolling Stones and the Kingsmen were among those who recorded it. The Beatles' version was begun on July 18, 1963 with six takes, plus a piano edit piece. Unsatisfied, [[George Martin]] recorded seven more attempts at the piano on July 30. The final version being an edit of takes six and seven, which was mixed for mono. The song was considered complete.\n\nLater, \"Money was returned to on September 30 when Martin added three more piano pieces. It was the final song to be mixed for stereo on October 30, just 23 days before ''[[With the Beatles]]'' hit the stores.\n\nBecause of the unusual mixing, recording and remixing nature of this song, there are very noticeable difference between the mono and stereo versions of \"Money.\" The most obvious being in its intro where the stereo has the superimpositions which were recorded after the basic mono mix was made.\n\n\"Money\" was one of the songs the Beatles selected for their failed Decca audition on January 1, 1962. John also chose it for his performance at the Rock & Roll revival appearance in Canada; later released on ''Live Peace in Toronto, 1969''.\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 rhythm guitar (1962 [[Gibson J-160E]]), lead vocals\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 bass guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1961 Hofner 500/1]]), backing vocals\n* [[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead guitar (1963 [[Gretsch Country Gentleman|Gretsch G6122 'Country Gentleman']]), backing vocals\n* [[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 drums (1960 Premier Duroplastic Mahogany)\n* [[George Martin]] - piano (1905 Steinway Vertegrand)\n[[Category:Cover Songs]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on With the Beatles]]\n[[Category:Meet The Beatles]]"}}}]}}}}
