It was written in May 1966 when Paul was on a skiing trip with girlfriend [[Jane Asher]]. The song was recorded on 9, 16 and 19 May 1966. McCartney sang and played clavichord (rented from George Martin's AIR company), piano and bass, while [[Ringo Starr]] played drums and tambourine. [[John Lennon]] and [[George Harrison]] did not contribute to the recording. However, Lennon had proclaimed that \"For No One\" was one of his favourite songs written by Paul McCartney.\n\nThe French Horn passage sounds similar to the Peter leitmotif from \"Peter and the Wolf\".\n\n== Credits ==\n* [[Paul McCartney]] - Lead Vocals, Bass Guitar ([[Rickenbacker 4001S]]), Piano, Clavichord\n* [[Ringo Starr]] - Drums, Tambourine\n* Alan Civil- French Horn\n\n{{song stub}}\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Revolver]]\n\n[[Category:1966 songs]]"}}}]}}}}
