It is the seventh and final song on side one of The Beatles' Second UK LP, \"[[With The Beatles]]\". It is credited to Georgia Dobbins, William Garrett, Freddie Gorman, Brian Holland, and Robert Bateman.\n\nThe Beatles included '''Please Mister Postman '''(a cover of a song by the Marvelettes) as part of their live act in 1962, performing it regularly at the [[Cavern Club]]. By the time it was recorded for their second album, [[With The Beatles]], it had been dropped from their set, and required some work in the studio to bring it up to an acceptable standard. [[Ian MacDonald]] criticised their version for having a \"wall of sound\" and for a \"general airlessness.\" It has become a fan favourite and even considered the best version by many.\n\nIt is a gender-flip cover version of an obscure Motown song by girl group The Marvelettes. The original can be heard on the compilation ''Dreamboats and Petticoats Five'' (disc 1, track 12)\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 double-tracked lead vocal, rhythm guitar ([[Rickenbacker 325|1958 Rickenbacker 325]]), handclaps\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 backing vocals, bass guitar ([[Hofner 500/1|1961 Hofner 500/1]]), handclaps\n* [[George Harrison]] \u2013 backing vocals, lead guitar ([[Grestch Country Gentleman|1962 Gretsch 6122 Country Gentleman]]), handclaps\n* [[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 drums, tambourine, handclaps\n*[[George Martin]] \u2013 producer\n*[[Norman Smith]] \u2013 engineer\nThe Beatles personnel per MacDonald\n\n==Credits==\nGeorgia Dobbins, William Garrett, Freddie Gorman, Brian Holland, Robert Bateman\n[[Category:Songs on With the Beatles]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Cover Songs]]\n[[Category:Meet The Beatles]]"}}}]}}}}
