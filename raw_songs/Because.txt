It features a 3-part harmony vocal performance between Lennon, McCartney and [[George Harrison]], overdubbed three times to make nine voices in all. The results of this have been compared in sound to [[wikipedia:The Beach Boys|The Beach Boys]]. It appeared on the 1969 album [[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]], and is the song that precedes the extended medley that formed side two of the original LP record.\n\nThe story has been told that this song is actually \"Moonlight Sonata\" by Ludwig van Beethoven played backwards. While this is not precisely true, \"Moonlight Sonata\" certainly served as an inspiration for the song. \"[[Yoko Ono|Yoko]] was playing Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' on the piano ... I said, 'Can you play those chords backwards?', and wrote 'Because' around them. The lyrics speak for themselves ... No imagery, no obscure references.\" Lennon explain.\n\nThe song begins with electric harpsichord played by George Martin and then joined by Lennon's guitar doubling the harpsichord and played through a Leslie speaker. Vocals and bass guitar enter in what Alan Pollack calls the \"mini-bridge\".\n\nThe song was one of the few Beatles songs to include an analogue synthesizer arrangement (although analogue keyboards such as the Mellotron had been used often by The Beatles, few songs featured the use of a traditional analogue synthesizer with voltage-controlled oscillators). The Beatles at the time of Abbey Road were among the first contemporary rock bands to experiment with the Moog synthesizer.\n\nThe main recording session for \"Because\" was on 1 August 1969, with vocal overdubs on 4 August, and a Moog synthesizer overdub by George Harrison on 5 August. As a result, this was the last song on the album to be committed to tape, although there were still overdubs for other incomplete songs.\n\nA vocals-only version of the song can be found on [[Anthology 3]] and [[Love (album)|Love]] is an example of three part harmony from Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, although the latter is slowed down, includes quiet nature sound effects and includes the 'Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhh' at the beginning while the former starts just with 'Because' and includes the instrumentation in the background.\n\n==Cover Versions ==\nThe song as covered by Elliot Smith plays over the end credits in American Beauty.\n\nAlice Cooper as \"The Sun King\" sings the song in the 1978 film version of \u00a0[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)]]\n\n{{Infobox song\n | name       = Because\n | video      = [[File:The Beatles- Because|200px]]\n}}\n==Recording and Release Dates==\nIt was recorded on 1\u20135 August 1969 in EMI Studios. and released on 26 September 1969.\n\n==Credits==\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 triple-tracked lead harmony vocals (middle register), lead guitar (1965 [[Epiphone 230TD Casino]])\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 triple-tracked lead harmony vocals (high register), bass (1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]])\n* [[George Harrison]] \u2013 triple-tracked lead harmony vocals (low register), Moog Synthezier\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 handclaps *unused in the final mix*\n* [[George Martin]] \u2013 electric spinet Baldwin harpsichord\n\nPersonnel per Ian MacDonald.\n\n[[ru:Because]]\n[[es:Because]]\n\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tabfan.com/en/the-beatles/because/abbey-road Chords of this Song] at tabfan.com\n\n[[Category:Songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n[[Category:The Beatles songs]]\n[[Category:Songs on Abbey Road]]"}}}]}}}}
