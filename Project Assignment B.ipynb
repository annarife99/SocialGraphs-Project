    "Some first conclusions can be extracted from these communities. Although most of them share some of the most common words, some differences between them can be observed. For example in the community 4, including love me do song, love is the most used word, but ill, mine, true and cant are the other words. In contrast, in community 8, including I want to hold your hand song, although love is also the most used word, the other most common ones are say, know, good and hello. Despite this is not enough to affirm that there exist significant differences between the communities, the general perception about love seems to change, with a more sad-negative perspective in community 4 and a more optimistic-joyful love in the community 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we take a look in the unique words, in other words, in how many songs of the community a word appears, it is observed howthe most common ones are just present in half of the songs of the community, indicating that although there is a sense of belonging in each community, the partition is still far from being well done in terms of separating topics, and usually each community is a mix of different words-moods."

    "To compute the sentimental analysis for each community, LabMT method was used when dealing with cleaned lyrics that just contained the most important and characteristic words for each song. However, first it was needed to lemmatize, set to lower case, and tokenize the words so they will not be used twice. This was already implemented in clean_lyrics() function. \n",

    "In order to have a first visualization of the results a scatter plot was aimed, where the x-axis corresponded to the year and the y-axis to the mean labMT value per song. Moreover, each community would be represented with a specific colour. In order to achieve so, a dataframe was created, including the name of each song, the year, the labMT average value and the community it belonged to. Only songs that are in the GCC and in the Beatles Golden decade (1962-1970) have been included.\n",

    "It can be seen how there is not a clear tendency in the general mood of beatles songs as years pass by. According to LabMT analysis it could be said that Beatles songs tend to slightly increase its positivy as years go by, reaching its maximun average value at year 1968. From there, their positivity slightly decreases the last two years of this golden decade before their break-up at 1970.\n",
